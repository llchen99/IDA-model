The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\\n\\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \\netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \\nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \\n(Gershevitch, 1964).\\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\\nhierarchy.\\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\\nof Central Asia.\\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\\nthat of the priesthood: white.\\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\\nmaster of himself.\\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\\npriesthood, would be very strange.\\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\\'s treachings, as well as in\\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.', 'In <lsran6INN14a@exodus.Eng.Sun.COM> emarsh@hernes-sun.Eng.Sun.COM (Eric \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHuh?

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \\nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \\nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \\nthe histories I\\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \\nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\\nis possible that the histories I\\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\\nit - would it be in Hitler\\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \\n\\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \\nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \\nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false.

Since the accusations were made \\nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \\naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \\n1920\\'s and 30\\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \\ntime and plant \"tainted\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \\nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \\nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \\nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \\nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \\nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \\nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \\nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\\n\\n\\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \\n\\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \\nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people.

In fact, for the Bible to be of\\nany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a\\nworkable moral system created for everyday use.\\n\\nThe Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing\\nevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it.

For a Christian, the situation is no better.\\n\\nIt seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-\\nChristian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from\\nthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well\\nbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to\\nfollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was\\nwritten down by man.\\n\\nThis leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the\\ndivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many\\ndifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the\\nfifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do\\nthat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an\\nagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit\\nsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take\\nthe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create\\nand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables\\nthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers\\nhave done).\\n\\nWhatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I\\nthink the important aspect is the result.\\n\\nDavid.\\n\\n---\\nOn religion:', '\\n\\n\\nWhy should I keep my fingers crossed?

Where do they come \\n#from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from\\n#whatever is societally mandated.\\n\\nIt\\'s only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily\\nvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what\\nis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it\\'s a little\\nover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different\\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\\nbut is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating\\nmeat may be perfectly legal.\\n\\n#\\n#>#Merely a question for the basis of morality\\n#>#\\n#>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_.\\n#>#\\n#>#1)Who is society\\n#\\n#>Depends on the society.\\n#\\n#Doesn\\'t help.  Is the point irrelevant?\\n\\nNo.  Often the answer is \"we are\".  But if society is those who make\\nthe rules, that\\'s a different question.  If society is who should\\nmake the rules, that\\'s yet another.  I don\\'t claim to have the answers, either,\\nbut I don\\'t think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things\\nabout the US system, at least in principle.\\n\\n#\\n#>#2)How do \"they\" define what is acceptable?\\n#\\n#>Depends.\\n#On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).\\n\\nWell, ideally they don\\'t, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.\\n#\\n#>#3)How do we keep from a \"whatever is legal is what is \"moral\" \"position?\\n#\\n#>By adopting a default position that people\\'s moral decisions\\n#>are none of society\\'s business,\\n#\\n#So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?\\n\\nBecause sometimes that\\'s necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when\\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn\\'t.\\n\\n# and only interfering when it\\'s truly\\n#>necessary.\\n#\\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\\n\\nIMO, it isn\\'t often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \\nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it\\'s a sort of\\nliar\\'s paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification\\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn\\'t object if\\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn\\'t arise if\\nwe don\\'t actively wish to take way anyone\\'s freedom.\\n#\\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\\n#\\n#They see the need for a \"justice\" system.  How can we even define that term?\\n\\nOnly by consensus, I guess.\\n\\n#  Thus you\\n#>get a situation where \"The law often allows what honour forbids\", which I\\'ve\\n#>come to believe is as it should be.  \\n#\\n#I admit I don\\'t understand that statement.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may\\nalso be seen as immoral.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\ndetermnined.\\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\nacquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\nan event can have value. \\nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\nI didn\\'t make these rules, it\\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\\nthought, even your own.

In order to try and cut down on this, the\\nalt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following\\ntitles:\\n\\n   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers\\n   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism\\n   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\\n   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument\\n   5.

The\\nothers are entirely optional.\\n\\nIf you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup\\nnews.announce.newusers.  The articles titled \"A Primer on How to Work With\\nthe Usenet Community\", \"Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet\"\\nand \"Hints on writing style for Usenet\" are particularly relevant.

Here are\\nsome suggestions on what to do if you can\\'t find them:\\n\\n1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with\\n   \"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\".\\n\\n2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\\n\\n   If you don\\'t find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn\\'t set up\\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\\n   problem.\\n\\n3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].\\n   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you\\'ll find the latest\\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\\n\\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you\\n   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to\\n   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\\n      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq\\n\\n   in the body.\\n\\n4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\\n   \"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\" carries a list of these\\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\\n\\n5. If you don\\'t have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\\n   consisting of the following lines:\\n\\n      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources\\n\\n5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of\\n   the following lines:\\n\\n      send atheism/faq/faq.txt\\n      send atheism/faq/logic.txt\\n      send atheism/faq/intro.txt\\n      send atheism/faq/resource.txt\\n\\n   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.\\n   There\\'s other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \"help\" and\\n   \"send atheism/index\".\\n\\n6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\\n   if you\\'ve tried the above methods and they\\'ve failed; it\\'s not nice to\\n   clutter the newsgroup or people\\'s mailboxes with requests for files.\\n   it\\'s better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,\\n   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don\\'t have \\n   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.\\n', ': Marian CATHOLIC high school, outside of chicago:\\n: \\n: 666 south ASHLAND avenue.\\n: \\nActually, Satanism is technically inverted Catholicism.\\n', '\\nLooking at [1] we find that during Roman times \"Tyre vied with Sidon\\nfor first place in the intellectual life of the period\"; that Tyre was\\nthe seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it;\\nthat \"the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia\" was the\\nbasilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its\\nexports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre,\\nalong with other seaports, \"provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian\\nand even Chinese trade\"; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing\\npopulation by \"following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line\\nof growth\" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre\\nestablished colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a \"small\\nfishing village\" by any stretch of the imagination.\\n\\nCenturies later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had \"opulent and flourishing\\nbazaars\" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was\\n\"noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.\"\\nDuring the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held\\nby Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)\\n\\nIn [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: \"other\\n*major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and\\nZahlah.\"  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of\\nthe Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982)\\non the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel\\'s\\nwithdrawel in 1984, \"Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local\\neconomy.\"\\n\\nIf Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present,\\nwhy is it always called a city (or, above, a \"major city\")?  Why\\ndoes it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities\\nin Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the\\nlist (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?\\n\\n[1] Philip K.

(1982 est.) 23,000.\"  \\nMost other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range.\\n(One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same\\nsource give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also,\\nso I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for\\nthe cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don\\'t doubt that the\\npopulation of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In\\nparticular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.   \\n\\n\\nI thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed.\\nDon\\'t most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to \\nthe other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make\\na case for Tyre having been singled out?\\n\\n\\nThey had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]:\\nTyre \"receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes\\nand from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a\\nlarge series of coins, occasionally in gold ...\"\\n\\nThe descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don\\'t seem to fit\\nyour characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems\\nto have been allowed to flourish.

Gay people are and will\\ncon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may\\nbe unaware of all the statistica \"findings\" concerning African-Americans that\\nhave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias\\nagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,\\nbut there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public\\nscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.\\nFortunately African-Americans had \"whites\" who supported their \\'cause\\' and\\npublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was\\neven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws\\nwere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty\\nmuch legal to discriminate against them.\\n\\nI know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free\\nform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,\\nthat is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)\\nopenly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,\\nincluding gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation\\nand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord\\'s great commandment to Love,\\nand we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular\\nto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a\\nchurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes\\nin the commandment of Love (though I\\'m hard-pressed to find many who actually\\nsho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially\\nwithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian\\ncommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists\\nagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and\\ntreated as runaway slaves for being \"nigger-lovers\" and such.  I guess I\\'ve\\ndecided the challenge is worth it.\\n\\nIn my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic\\nstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight\\nwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don\\'t know of one\\ncase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject\\ntheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they\\nbegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.\\n\\nI\\'m apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0\\nraged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values\\nCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner\\nsupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more\\noppressive legisation against gays.\\n\\nPerhaps you don\\'t get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn\\'t get it in the\\nMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God\\'s will be done as they massacred thousands\\nin witch hunts and inquisitions.\\n\\nThe message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay\\nrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even\\nhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn\\'t change\\nthe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the\\nfinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a\\n\"conditional\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we\\'ll love you. This is\\nsure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \"unconditional\"\\nlove, one that calls people \"just as they are.\"  Sure there are things that\\nwill \\'naturally\\' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that\\nneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things\\nlike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is\\ngoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \"other\\npeople\\'s expectations.\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many\\npeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have\\nnothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their\\nown sense of pseuper-spirituality.\\n\\nThis is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be\\nunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with\\nsomething very personal like \\'sexuality\\' (a taboo subject even today), but I\\nfirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation\\non thier bedrooms.  It\\'s funny that most straight people have successfully\\nremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,\\nbut we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it\\nhelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.\\nGay people are not criminals.\\n\\nAnother interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic\\nchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it\\'s pastors arrested for self-\\nadmitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently\\nbeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were\\nvoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that\\nwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing\\nhappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends\\nrecently told me he was \"approached\" by someone who is going through the\\nreparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for\\ndinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.\\n\\nThese are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and\\ncreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not\\nthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in\\nColorado has created an organization who\\'s posters are appearing all over\\nColorado called \"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\" (I forget the whole definition off hand,\\nbut the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto\\nis \"Working for a fag-free America\" with an implicit advocation for violence.\\n\\nThis is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are\\nembracing.\\n\\nWe Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression\\ntowards those we feel don\\'t \\'measure up\\', and constant beratement from\\norganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good\\npurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of\\nexcluding people.\\n\\nThe Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \"include\"\\npeople.

Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \\nKellner\\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\\nin Reuss\\'s Masonic publication, \\'Oriflamme\\'.  On Kellner\\'s death,\\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \\'Jubilee\\' edition of\\nthe \\'Oriflamme\\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\\nsecret of sexual magic.\\n \\n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\\nLeague founded by Karl Marx\\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\\n\\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\\' leadership.\\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\\n\\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\\'s request, deeply\\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\\n\\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\\'\\n\\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \\n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\\nfor very many interpretations.\\n\\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\\nsupport of the \\'Law of Thelema\\' is laughable at best.\\n\\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \\nWill I?  \\nI think not.\\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\\n\\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\\nI do not support Reuss\\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\\nthe Order has \\'gone soft\\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\\n\\n\\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \\nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\\nof the organization as it stands.\\n\\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \\nI followed my intuition, and I\\'ve found little to stop me from requesting\\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I\\'m happily participating\\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\\nMass well enough for my tastes.\\n \\n\\nThis doesn\\'t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\\nlimited contact with other members.\\n\\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\\nand the preservation of individual vision.\\n\\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\\nto other posts in this thread.\\n\\n\\nInvoke me under my stars.

However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there\\neven though it is not detectable.\\n\\nYour description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but\\nI get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions\\ncan sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven\\'t attempted to\\ndefine the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of\\neach Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a\\nsimilar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is\\neasy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I\\nmisunderstood?\\n\\n\\nMy p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and\\nhis writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do\\nmy bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)\\nis that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this\\nwill probably take several generations to be effective. I don\\'t think that the\\nlist of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element\\nmay come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his\\ntransactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what\\ngives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.\\n\\nI\\'ve had some more thoughts on my definitions:\\n\\nI\\'ve was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions\\nin order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of\\nthe Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a\\ngraphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of\\nfrequencies and the chosen \\'amplitudes\\', and the Moral Character being the\\nspectrum over time.\\n\\nConscience is a little more difficult because I can\\'t define it as the\\nreasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature\\nbecause Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often\\nunwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given\\ntime which compromises one\\'s Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with\\nFreud\\'s SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the\\nurges or Freud\\'s Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud\\'s Ego,\\nI suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why\\nConscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \"what\\nprovides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\". I think I need some\\nmore time with this one.\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for now!\\n\\nDavid.\\n\\n---\\nOn religion:', '\\n\\nYes I fully agree with that, but is it \"I don\\'t believe gods exist\", or\\n\"I believe no gods exist\"?

For example, it sometimes\\nhappens that someone says \"My grandson is the cutest baby!\" and then turns\\naround and sees the granddaughter and says \"Oh!  Isn\\'t she the cutest thing!?\"\\n\\nThis person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the\\nworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for\\nfirst.

The only way\\nto get from `fishing nets\\' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large\\npopulation\\' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.\\n\\nIn other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the\\nprophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal\\nreading, they could read this passage and conclude \"medium-size city\".\\n\\nYou seem to feel that \"Never be rebuilt\" means \"be rebuilt\" -- maybe so, but\\nit is hardly a `clear implication\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, no.

However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29\\nEzekiel even quotes God as saying \"he and his army got no reward from the\\ncampaign he led against Tyre.\"\\n\\nLet\\'s ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.\\nEzekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.

Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThis post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability\\nto rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.\\n\\nFor example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26\\nby pulling some \"clear implications\" out of hat.\\n\\nWhen Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your towers\", that clearly implied\\nthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers\\nused to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your fine houses\\nand throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\", that clearly implied\\nthat N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.\\nwould \"build a ramp up to your walls\", that clearly implies that N. would\\nspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the\\nwalls.\\n\\nSee?

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\\n\\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\\nargument.\\n\\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\\nthe right tool for the job.\\n\\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\\n\\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\\n\\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\\nthree stages.\\n\\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \\n\\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\\npremises.  If something doesn\\'t seem obvious to you, don\\'t be afraid to\\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you\\'re right, it is obvious\" when\\nyou\\'ve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\\n\\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\\n\\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \\nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \\nsometimes a little confusing.\\n\\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\\n\\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\\n or the Son of God.\"\\n\\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \\nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\\'ll\\ncome to those later.)\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\\n\\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\\nargument.\\n\\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\\nB\".  If we\\'re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\\nstatement is an argument.  If we\\'re trying to establish the truth of B, then\\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\\n\\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- This is an explanation.\\n\\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\\nconclusion is true.\\n\\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\\n\\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\\ncarefully.\\n\\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \\nFor example:\\n\\n   All insects have wings (premise)\\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\\n\\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\\'s premises are false. \\nIf the argument\\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \\nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\\n\\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\\nas in:\\n\\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\\n\\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \\n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\\n\\nPremise Conclusion Inference\\n   A        B        A=>B\\n----------------------------\\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\\n\\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\\n\\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclusion must be true.\\n\\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \\nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\\n\\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\\n\\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\\nconvincing.\\n\\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\\nexhaustive.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\\n\\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \\nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\\n\\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\\n\\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\\n\\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \\nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\\'s\\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\\n\\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\\nthe opponent\\'s particular circumstances.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\\notherwise when you\\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\\n\\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\\nthe opponent\\'s argument.\\n\\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \\nYou\\'re white.\"\\n\\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\\'s\\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\\n\\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \\nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\\n\\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\\nsuch flood occurred.\"\\n\\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\\nhowever.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\\n\\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \\ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \\nconclusion accepted.  For example:\\n\\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\\'t find me\\nguilty; I\\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\\n\\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\\n\\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\\n\\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\\n\\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\\n\\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\\n\\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\\n\\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\\nbetween:\\n\\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \\nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\\nspecific.  For example:\\n\\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\\ndislike atheists.\"\\n\\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\\n\\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\\n\\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\\ninsincere.\"\\n\\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\\n\\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\\nhasty generalization.\\n\\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\\n\\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\\ncured me of the headache.\"\\n\\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\\natheism for the same reasons.\"\\n\\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\\n\\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\\nconclusion reached.\\n\\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \\nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \\nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\\nfor the British Secret Services\\' official ban on homosexual employees. \\nAnother example is the classic:\\n\\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\\n\\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\\n\\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \\nquestion:\\n\\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\\n\\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\\nwhen they ask questions like:\\n\\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\\n\\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\\n\\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\\n\\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\\n\\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \\nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\\nwith that conclusion.\\n\\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\\n\\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nEQUIVOCATION\\n\\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\\n\\nAMPHIBOLY\\n\\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\\n\\nACCENT\\n\\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\\n\\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\\nand\\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\\n\\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\\n\\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\\n\\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\\n\\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\\n\\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\\n\\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\\n\\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\\n\\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\\neach item.  For example:\\n\\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\\n\\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\\nfirst event.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand we\\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\\n\\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Isn\\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\\'t the Bible also a form of\\nhistory?\"\\n\\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\\'t Islam a\\nform of Christianity?\"\\n\\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\\'t dogs a form of cat?\"\\n\\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\\na fallacy.\\n\\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\\nanything about B.\\n\\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\\n\\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\\nbecause it is old, or because \"that\\'s the way it\\'s always been.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\\n\\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\\nthan something else.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\\n\\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\\n\\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\\n\\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\\n\\nBIFURCATION\\n\\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\\nalternatives exist or can exist.\\n\\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\\nquestion.\\n\\nNON SEQUITUR\\n\\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\\n\\nRED HERRING\\n\\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\\'s attention is diverted away from the\\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\\n\\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\\n\\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\\n\\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\\n\\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\\n\\nSTRAW MAN\\n\\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\\'s position so that it\\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\\n\\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \\ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \\nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\\n\\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legislation:\\n\\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\\n\\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\\n Martin Luther King.\"\\n\\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\\n\\nTU QUOQUE\\n\\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\\n\\n\"You\\'re just being randomly abusive.\"\\n\"So?  You\\'ve been abusive too.\"', '\\nSo why do I read in the papers that the Qumram texts had \"different\\nversions\" of some OT texts.   Did I misunderstand?', '\\n\\nOh, Bobby. You\\'re priceless. Did I ever tell you that?\\n\\nMy policy with Bobby\\'s posts, should anyone give a damn, is to flick\\nthrough the thread at high speed, searching for posts of Bobby\\'s which\\nhave generated a whole pile of followups, then go in and extract the\\nhilarious quote inevitably present for .sig purposes.

You refer to\\n     differing interpretations of \"create,\" and say that many Christians may\\n     not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith\\n     on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is\\n     truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.\\n\\n     Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created\\n     and eternally existent are equivalent, you say \"granted the Mormon\\n     belief...\" You can\\'t grant your conclusion and then expect the point to\\n     have been addressed.

Literally. There is\\n     nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible\\n     says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:\\n\\n          The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the \\n          kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];\\n          (Matthew 13:38)\\n\\n          I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which \\n          ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38)\\n\\n          Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not \\n          born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said \\n          unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I \\n          proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he \\n          sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye \\n          cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the \\n          lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the \\n          beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in \\n          him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a \\n          liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)\\n\\n          And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of \\n          the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease \\n          to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)\\n\\n          Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this \\n          world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit \\n          that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)\\n\\n          In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the \\n          devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he \\n          that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)\\n\\n     One becomes a child of God...\\n\\n          But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the\\n          sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)\\n\\n          Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that\\n          we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us\\n          not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,\\n          and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when\\n          he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he\\n          is. (1 John 3:1-2)\\n\\n     ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:\\n\\n          Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of\\n          the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)\\n\\n          Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus\\n          Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,\\n          (Ephesians 1:5)\\n\\n          Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should\\n          be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)\\n\\n          For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of\\n          God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;\\n          but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,\\n          Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we\\n          are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16)\\n\\n          Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one\\n          that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.

A few\\nyears ago, they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry: they concluded\\nthat it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality.\\nHowever, Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry, and\\nlast year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry.  (I got the\\nfeeling that they were saying \"You got the wrong answer last time, try to\\ndo better and get the answer we want.\")\\n\\nAnyway, there\\'s been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but\\nthe dust has settled and the report is in.  Nobody is entirely happy with it,\\nbut everybody seems willing to live with it.  Both sides are saying things\\nsuch as: \"This was the best we were going to get in the current environment.\"\\n\\nThe report commends the Masons for the charity work they do, such as the\\nhospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the\\nelderly and prevent drug abuse.  The report acknowledges that many well-\\nknown Christians are and have been Masons, and notes that many teachings\\nof Masonry are \"supportive of Christian faith and practice\".  Examples of\\nthe latter include belief in God, emphases on honesty and integrity, and\\nthat some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs.\\n\\nOn the other hand, they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible\\nwith Southern Baptist principles.  These included the use of titles which some\\npeople consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they\\nare not meant seriously), the \"undeniably pagan and/or occultic\" writings of\\nsome Masonic leaders, the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation\\ncan be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many\\nMasonic lodges.  (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole\\naren\\'t really in a place to speak on this last point.)\\n\\n\\nThe report concludes that Masonry is not a religion, and says that membership\\nshould not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals.\\nThis was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges,\\nand while one may include elements strongly against Christianity, another may\\nnot.  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of\\nthe believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably\\ninfluenced how the report came out.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThe information above was gleaned from \"The Religious Herald\", a publication\\nof the Baptist General Association of Virginia, and \"Baptists Today\", which\\ndoes not have any direct links to a religious organisation.

In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes\\nsense.  Matt 5:17 \"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or\\nthe Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\"  Jesus lived\\nunder the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises\\nof the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey\\nGod\\'s purposes.\\n\\nVerse 18 says \"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass\\naway, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,\\nuntil all is accomplished.\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last \\nphrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \"accomplished\" what the \\nLaw was supposed to accomplish.  \\n\\nVerse 19:  \"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,\\nand so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;\\nbut whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the\\nkingdom of heaven.\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish \\npeople about living lives under the law, this makes sense.\\n\\nIn general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he \\nmust have received about \"doing away with the Law.\"  That was not \\nJesus\\' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it \\nshould be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his \\npeople all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your \\nheel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \"doing \\naway with the Law\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as \\nequal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious \\nleaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only \\nGod\\'s Law.\\n\\nIn the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law \\nand defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon \\non the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people \\nunderstand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which \\nhad been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.\\n\\nIn Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the \\nLaw in this way:\\n\\n[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being \\nshut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore \\nthe Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be \\njustified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no \\nlonger under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith \\nin Christ Jesus.\\n\\nI believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had \\nserved it\\'s purpose, i.e. \"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\" and\\nnow, \"we are no longer under a tutor.\"  The law has been \"fulfilled\" \\nas Christ said he would do.\\n\\nGod, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same\\npersonality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \"last\\nwill and testament\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. \\nIt makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are\\nre-expressed in Christianity. \\n\\nOn the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it\\'s purpose and \\nChristians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes \\nsense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to \\nrepresent the \"mysteries\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism \\nrepresenting Christ\\'s death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),\\nThe Lord\\'s supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and\\nSunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,\\nActs 20:7)\\n\\nOK, That\\'s one Christian\\'s explanation.

Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human\\nspecies, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?\\n\\n2) Science cannot explain origins.\\n\\nThis is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends\\non what origins we are talking about.\\n\\n3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins\\nis to say that there is no higher truth than science.\\n\\nAgain, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \"higher\\ntruth\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways\\nto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even\\nbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many\\nbelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language\\nof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \"higher\" or \\n\"lower\"; they are simply true.\\n\\nMore to the point, restricting one\\'s discussion of origins to science\\ndoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the\\nscope of discussion.\\n\\n4) This is a false premise.\\n\\nIf this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false\\nthen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another\\nfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.\\n\\n5) By the way, I enjoy science.\\n\\nOn the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science\\nto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say\\nthat one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.\\nHowever one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,\\nperhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.\\n\\n6) It is truly a wonder observing God\\'s creation.\\n\\nLet us not quibble; count this one as true.\\n\\n7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent\\nreligion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]\\n\\nStill another false statement.  However one can make it come out true\\nwith the following contextual modification:\\n\\n\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent\\nof what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of\\nwhat Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\"\\n\\n-----\\n\\nIt is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch\\non truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do\\nhim the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his\\npersonal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that\\nhe has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.', '\\n\\n\\nCorrection: _hard_ atheism is a faith.\\n\\n\\n\\nGet a grip, man.

It seems from your\\ncomments below that you understood this as meaning \"morally justified\".\\nI apologize.\\n\\n\\nI have often wondered about this.  I\\'ve always thought that the first bomb\\nshould have been dropped on Japan\\'s island fortress of Truk.  A good,\\ninpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could\\'ve been held back\\nfor use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.\\n\\nYes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan\\nwas seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately,\\nthe military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US\\'s\\nulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made\\nwhich affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the \\ncircumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the\\nsuffering caused by those decisions.  \\n\\n[...]\\n\\n\\nActually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US\\nand allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other\\nback-water country, we probably wouldn\\'t intervene.  Not that we don\\'t\\ncare, but we can\\'t be the world\\'s policman.  Or if a coup had occured\\nin Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn\\'t have acted\\nbecause there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to\\nSaudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion\\nby a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West\\'s oil \\ninterests, caused us to take action.\\n\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nI\\'m not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the\\nwar, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep\\nKuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.\\n\\nWell, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler\\nwould lead their nation to.\\n\\n\\nThey suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much?\\nThe world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many\\ninnocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable,\\nbut that\\'s The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nProbably because we\\'re not the saviors of the world.

Nor\\nare we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or\\nsome other places.\\n\\nTell me how we could stop them and I\\'ll support it.

You can criticize\\nthe system, but let\\'s not have unfounded allegations of racial \\nprejudice thrown around.\\n\\n\\nNo, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks\\non the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.\\n\\n\\nGermans, perhaps.  \"Peers\" doesn\\'t mean \"those who do the same thing\",\\nlike having murderers judge murderers.  It means \"having people from\\nthe same station in life\", presumably because they are in a better\\nposition to understand the defendent\\'s motivation(s).\\n\\n\\nOK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your*\\nlogical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.\\n\\nThe media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing\\nliberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give\\na balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative\\nsources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)\\n\\nBTW, I never used the word \"conspiracy\".  I don\\'t accept (without *far*\\nmore evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal\\nconspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.\\n\\n\\nHardly.  I didn\\'t say that it\\'s a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people\\nif the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don\\'t live in a perfect world and\\nthere are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then\\ninnocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn\\'t say\\nit is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.\\n\\n\\nI would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain\\nand suffering.  I\\'m not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That\\nconclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.\\nAnd perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let\\'s say) we now know.  That doesn\\'t\\nmean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn\\'t see it as\\nbeing necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of\\nan action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed\\nnecessary enough to go ahead with it.\\n\\nBut don\\'t assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I\\ndon\\'t!  I just don\\'t condemn those who had to make a difficult\\ndecision under difficult circumstances.\\n\\n\\nYou certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist.\\nI, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.\\n\\n\\nWrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to\\nthose making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply\\nrefuse to condemn them for their decision.\\n\\nOne day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action;\\neven this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of\\nthat, and I am prepared to do so.  I don\\'t believe that you can make the\\nsame claim.\\n\\n\\nAnd BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was\\nbecause you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being \\n\"so deplorable\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing\\nwasn\\'t accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a\\ndecisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,\\nprecision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big\\nstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted\\n*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians\\n(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing\\nin WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some\\ncivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than\\nany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives\\nwith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories\\nof \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.\\nYes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years\\nand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But \\nwe are expected to swallow that \"hundreds of thousands\" of \\n*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!

An impressive amount of\\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\\n\\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\\nif introns are inserted.

I do\\nnot know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and\\nopen hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know\\nthat\\nhistorically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone\\nby the death penalty.\\n\\nMy understanding is that Khomeini\\'s ruling was not based on the\\nlaw of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\\nprecedent in the Qur\\'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\\n\\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \"fasad\". This\\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was\\nnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.\\n\\n\\nI would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was\\nlevelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication\\nof the book. However, the charge of \"fasad\" can encompass a\\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\\n\"crisis\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\\nlevelled at people, not books.\\n\\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \\nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\\n\\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.', 'The Nicene Creed\\n\\nWE BELIEVE in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.\\nAnd in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, Very God of Very God, begotten not made, being of one substance with the Father by whom all things were made; who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and was made man, and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate.

And he shall come again with glory to judge  both the quick and the dead, whose kingdom shall have no end.', 'THE DIVINE MASTERS       \\n      \\n               Most Christians would agree, and correctly so, that \\n          Jesus Christ was a Divine Master, and a projection of God \\n          into the physical world, God Incarnate. \\n          \\n               But there are some very important related facts that \\n          Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of \\n          most other world religions. \\n           \\n               First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-\\n          STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master \\n          (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, \\n          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and \\n          after the life of Jesus. \\n    \\n               The followers of some of these Masters founded the \\n          world\\'s major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of \\n          their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added \\n          THREATS of \"ETERNAL DAMNATION\" in Hell, and DELETED the \\n          teaching of REincarnation. \\n       \\n               Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular \\n          Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is \\n          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively \\n          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY \\n          alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE \\n          UNIVERSES.)                             \\n\\n               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and \\n          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from \\n          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed \\n          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly \\n          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. \\n      \\n               And emotional \"feelings\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING \\n          indicator for religious validity. \\n    \\n               These things are similarly true for followers of most \\n          other major world religions, including Islam. \\n     \\n               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune \\n          His Initiates into the \"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\" or \"SOUND \\n          CURRENT\", (referred to as \"THE WORD\" in John 1:1-5, and as \\n          \"The River of Life\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally \\n          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they \\n          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a \\n          \"silver cord\". \\n    \\n               True Salvation, which completes a Soul\\'s cycles of \\n          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved \\n          only by reaching at least the \"SOUL PLANE\", which is five \\n          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this \\n          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine \\n          Master. \\n    \\n               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri \\n          Harold Klemp, the Living \"Eck\" Master or \"Mahanta\" for the \\n          \"Eckankar\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, \\n          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). \\n    \\n               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now \\n          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \"Sant \\n          Mat\" organization. \\n      \\n               One of the classic books on this subject is \"THE PATH OF \\n          THE MASTERS\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  \\n          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian \\n          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India \\n          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of \\n          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. \\n    \\n               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored \\n          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in \\n          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or \\n          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \"ECKANKAR--THE \\n          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER \\n          classic. \\n    \\n               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with \\n          the \"Anti-Christ\", which is or was to be a temporary world \\n          dictator during the so-called \"last days\".  But the Masters \\n          don\\'t ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as \\n          Jesus was. \\n    \\n               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or \\n          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will \\n          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the \\n          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they \\n          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine \\n          Master. \\n    \\n          \\n    \\n          RE-INCARNATION\\n          \\n               The book \"HERE AND HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery, \\n          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation \\n          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past \\n          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes \\n          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], \\n          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of \\n          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, \\n          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-\\n          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-\\n          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-\\n          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS \\n          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the \\n          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How \\n          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED \\n          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \"KING JAMES VERSION\".  Later \\n          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] \\n          \\n               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., \\n          typically originate from a person\\'s PAST LIVES.  For example, \\n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \\n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \\n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \\n          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, \\n          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \\n          INCARNATION. \\n\\n               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF \\n          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would \\n          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their \\n          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the \\n          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \\n\\n\\n\\n          \"2nd COMINGS\"\\n\\n               If a Divine Master physically dies (\"translates\") \\n          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that \\n          Initiate physically dies (\"translates\"), the Master will meet \\n          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul \\n          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd \\n          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that \\n          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still \\n          waiting for Jesus\\' \"2nd Coming\" are WAITING IN VAIN. \\n    \\n          \\n          \\n          PLANES OF EXISTENCE\\n\\n               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN \\n          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the \\n          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric \\n          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), \\n          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The \\n          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from \\n          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the \\n          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. \\n    \\n               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological \\n          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See \\n          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without \\n          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between \\n          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. \\n    \\n               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a \\n          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \"Hades\", and the \\n          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there \\n          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some \\n          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a \\n          THREATENING manner.  The Christian \"Heaven\" is located \\n          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there \\n          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH\\n\\n               The Christian religion demands of its followers an \\n          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more \\n          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). \\n       \\n               If a person is not HEARING some form of the \"SOUND \\n          CURRENT\" (\"THE WORD\", \"THE BANI\", \"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\"), \\n          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL \\n          CONTINUE. \\n    \\n               The \"SOUND CURRENT\" manifests differently for different \\n          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on \\n          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a \\n          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.

As director of FREE\\nINDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering\\ndiscontented gays and lesbians \"a way out of the homosexual death-style\"\\nthrough prayer.  \"I\\'d like to give the award back,\" Caligiuri now laughs, \"I\\'m\\nno longer deserve it.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\'s eight year involvement with the national \"ex-gay\" movement peaked\\nwith his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well\\nas Free Indeed.

He left me tied up all\\nnight, and the next morning he raped me again.\"\\n  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the\\nhome he shared with his ex-lover.  \"He had another man there with him,\"\\nCaligiuri recalls.  \"I thought at this time, \\'If this is what being gay is\\nabout, I don\\'t want to be this way anymore.\"\\n  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery\\nwith others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix\\'s\\ngay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its\\nfirst public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,\\nFree Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed\\nfor hell.\\n  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks\\nin part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  \"We were listed\\nunder Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,\" Caligiuri says, \"so people\\nthought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out\\nwhere the local bars were, and we\\'d preach to them about the sins of homo-\\nsexuality.\"  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,\\nadding, \"They\\'ll do anything to reach these people.\"\\n  \"David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,\" recalls Peter\\nKelly, a counselor at Phoenix\\'s Catholic diocese AIDS program, \"like that\\nhe knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\'s family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on\\nRaphael\\'s syndicated talk show in 1985.  \"They were relieved,\" he recalls.\\n\"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better\\nthat I should be a \\'reformed\\' gay person.\"\\n  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  \"By the time I appeared on Sally\\'s\\nshow,\" \"I\\'d started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline\\nand tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their\\nfather.  I was horny all the time.\"\\n  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his\\nnumerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he \"used to go to bookstores\\nand get blowjobs.\"  When he wasn\\'t working the bookstores, he was sleeping\\nwith other \"reformed\" homosexuals.\\n  \"I didn\\'t realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex\\nwith one another,\" Caligiuri says.  \"We\\'d go to conferences in other cities,\\nand we\\'d be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody\\nelse.\"\\n  By the time he appeared on \\'AM Philadelphia\\' television show in May 1988,\\nCaligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show\\'s\\nhost asked him if he ever \"acted on temptation,\" his answer was a lie.\\n  Caligiuri\\'s duplicity began to take it\\'s toll on him, however.  He was\\nsuffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating\\nyeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  \"I was too sick\\nto go to church,\" he explains.  \"The more time I spent away from those people\\nthe more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.\"\\n  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local\\nchurch and closed the ministry\\'s doors.  \"I\\'d convinced myself that there\\nis no need in the world for ex-gay people,\" he says.\\n  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (\"I\\'m interest-\\ned in belief systems that aren\\'t judgemental.\"), considering romance (\"But\\nnot with a CHristian!\"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.\\n\"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,\" he says.  \"I want to\\neventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I\\nmay have brought to our community.\"\\n\\n---end article---\\n\\nCaligiuri\\'s tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles\\nof former leaders and founders of \\'ex-gay\\' ministries who have said very similar th\\nsimilar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have\\ncome to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,\\nlike Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \"Lazarus Project\" of West\\nHollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community\\nto bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values\\nof sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become\\nand become close friends with many who once attended such groups as \"Love In\\nAction\" and others, who either once claimed to have been \"reformed\" or who\\nwere too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed\\nin them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of \"sealing\" their\\nnew heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses\\nand bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of\\nnight and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous \"sin\"\\nthrough a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch\\nhas dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-\\ncent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet\\nthe church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow\\ngay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also\\nmrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and\\nfear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on\\nthem, they may even opt for \\'suicide\\' or surgical dampering of the brain\\nfunctions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-\\nplace.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the\\nthreat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington\\'s\\n_\"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact\\nbased books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as\\nMaury Johnston\\'s _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser\\'s _Come Hom!_.

The Upanisads mark the\\nbeginning of transcendental life.\\n\\n As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in\\nthe material modes.

Whilst I\\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\\n\\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\\n\\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\\n\\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\\nmay not.\\n\\n\"What is atheism?\"\\n\\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\\natheism\".\\n\\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\\n\\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\\nflat-out denials.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn\\'t exist?\"\\n\\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\\n\\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\\n\\nThe term \\'agnosticism\\' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\\n\\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\\nsure whether God exists.\\n\\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\\nyou can work out someone\\'s philosophical point of view simply from the fact\\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\\n\\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\\nsure is that atheists don\\'t believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn\\'t\\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\\nabout the universe.\\n\\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it\\'s best to ask her.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\\nsee no evidence that God exists.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\\n\\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\\n\\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\\n\\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\\nmight be found, to show that it isn\\'t there.  Such an exhaustive search is\\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\\nprimes, because we can prove that they don\\'t exist.\\n\\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\\nthe time; they don\\'t believe in unicorns, even though they can\\'t conclusively\\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\\n\\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\\nprove that he doesn\\'t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\\n\\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\\nby any present-day religion exists.\\n\\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\\nGod are not really applicable.\\n\\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\\n\\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\\ndetectable.\\n\\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\\nimportance whether he exists or not.\\n\\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\\n\\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\\nfrom all the other things that don\\'t exist?\\n\\n\"OK, you may think there\\'s a philosophical justification for atheism, but\\n isn\\'t it still a religious belief?\"\\n\\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\\n\\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\\nthat it can\\'t be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\\n\\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn\\'t\\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\\nworship.\\n\\n[ It\\'s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\\n\\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\\n\\n\"OK, so it\\'s not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\\n\\nFirstly, it\\'s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\\nactually believes in.\\n\\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\\n\\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\\n\\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\\n\\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn\\'t fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn\\'t really match, as\\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\\n\\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it\\'s anti-religious?\"\\n\\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\\n\\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\\n\\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\\n\\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\\nmany countries.\\n\\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\\n\\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\\n\\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\\nchurch and state should remain separate.\\n\\n\"But if you don\\'t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\\n surely that\\'s the same as state atheism?\"\\n\\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\\nnature.\\n\\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\\n\\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there\\'s no God, why do you care if people\\n pray?\"\\n\\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\\nthat those who don\\'t pray can\\'t just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\\n\\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\\nmotives.\\n\\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\\n atheists?  Why aren\\'t there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don\\'t\\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\\n\\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\\n\\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn\\'t worth shouting about in\\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it\\'s somewhat cheap, not to say\\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\\nof religious beliefs.\\n\\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\\nrather strange idea; it\\'s rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\\n\\n\"You said atheism isn\\'t anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\\n one\\'s upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\\n\\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\\n\\nIt\\'s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\\nexpectations of others.\\n\\nOn the whole, we can\\'t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\\n\\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\\n\\nThey don\\'t believe in God.  That\\'s all there is to it.\\n\\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\\n\\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\\nappearance.\\n\\n\"Unexceptional? But aren\\'t atheists less moral than religious people?\"\\n\\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\\natheists are less moral as they don\\'t obey any God.  But usually when one\\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\\n\\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\\nof self-preservation.\\n\\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\\nwhat happens to others?  They don\\'t know, they simply are that way.\\n\\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\\nactions.  For example:\\n\\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\\n\\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\\n\\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\\n   before salvation; 5% after.\\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\\n\\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\\nbehaviour.\\n\\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\\n\\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\\n\\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world \\'ought\\' to work, rather\\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\\n\\n\"Then aren\\'t atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\\n\\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\\nwith what they observed around them.\\n\\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\\n\\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\\nindividual\\'s personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\\nchoice that person can honestly make.\\n\\n\"But don\\'t atheists want to believe in God?\"\\n\\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\\n\\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\\n\\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\\n\\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\\n\\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren\\'t looking properly\"\\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\\n\\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\\nfutile.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\\n\\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\\n\\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\\nthat has a \"meaning\".\\n\\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\\n\\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\\n\\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\\n\\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\\n\\nIn the end, it\\'s a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that\\'s just\\nhard luck.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\\n\\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\\n\\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\\n\\nThousands of years of religious belief haven\\'t resulted in any good proof of\\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\\n\\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don\\'t the same arguments\\n apply?\"\\n\\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\\n\\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\\nbut to everyone else.\\n\\n\"What sort of harm?\"\\n\\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It\\'s not\\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\\n\\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\\n\\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church\\'s opposition to birth control -- and\\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\\n\\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\\nreligion.\\n\\n\"Those weren\\'t REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\\n sort of excuse.\"\\n\\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it\\'s hard\\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who\\'s a REAL\\nChristian and who isn\\'t, when even the major Christian churches like the\\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can\\'t decide amongst themselves?\\n\\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can\\'t be\\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn\\'t he have\\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\\naren\\'t a perversion of what your God intended?\\n\\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\\nChristian.\\n\\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\\n\\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\\ndon\\'t exist, but that doesn\\'t make it unlikely that they are myths.\\n\\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\\n\\n\"Well, if atheism\\'s so great, why are there so many theists?\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\\n\\nOf course, there\\'s more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\\npurposes as well.\\n\\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\\n something?\"\\n\\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it\\'s\\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\\n\\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it\\'s\\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\\n\\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\\n that God exists?\"\\n\\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\\n\\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\\n\\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\\n nothing?\"\\n\\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\\n\\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\\nother memes.\\n\\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\\n\\n\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\\nfew of them; don\\'t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\\nreligions.\\n\\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\\n\\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\\n\\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it\\'s up to you to\\n   find it.\\n\\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\\n\\n   Make the most of your life, as it\\'s probably the only one you\\'ll have.\\n\\n   It\\'s no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\\n   yourself.\\n\\n   Just because something\\'s popular doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good.\\n\\n   If you must assume something, assume something it\\'s easy to test.\\n\\n   Don\\'t believe things just because you want them to be true.\\n\\nand finally (and most importantly):\\n\\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\\n\\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.2\\n\\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\\n=q2V5\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----', 'There are actually a few important things we can glean from this mess:\\n1)\\tWhen they start getting desperate for an answer to the question: \"What\\'s\\nit all about.

As the punctilious scholars have written\\nmany volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood,\\nhere we will briefly point out only the general category\\ninto which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted\\nas accurate reports.\\n    The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad\\n(SAW) fall into two main categories:  \\n\\n    The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal \\nevents that happened at the time of his birth, or before his \\ndeclaration of prophethood.  \\n\\n    The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences \\nof the prophethood, and contains two subdivisions: \\n\\n    1) Those wonders that were manifested after\\nhis departure from this world in order to confirm his\\nprophethood, and \\n\\t2) Those that he exhibited during the era\\nof his prophethood.  The latter has also two parts:  \\n\\t2.1) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest\\nin his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral\\nconduct and perfection, and \\n    2.2) The miracles that: related to substantial matters.  \\nThe last part again has two branches:  \\n\\t2.2.1) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality, and \\n\\t2.2.2) Those relating to matter and creation.  This last \\nbranch is again divided into two categories:  \\n\\t2.2.2.1) The first involves the paranormal happenings \\nthat occured during his mission either to break the \\nstubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment the\\nfaith of the belivers.  This category has twenty different\\nsorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing of\\nwater from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers with\\na little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animals\\nEach of these sons has also many instances, and thus\\nhas, in meaning, the strength of confirmation by\\nconsensus.  \\n\\t2.2.2.2)  As for the second category, this\\nincludes events lying in the future that occured as he had\\npredicted upon Allah (SWT)'s instructions.  Now starting\\nfrom the last category, we will summarize a list of them.(1)\\n\\n(1) Unfonunately, I could not write as I had intended\\nwithout choice, I wrote as my head dictated, and I could\\nnot completely conform to the order of this classification.\\n\", '\\nI became aware of the claim years ago.  So I decided to check it out, on my\\nown.  But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some \\nreferences.

[emphasis mine]\".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention\\nthe two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.\\n\\nSo far as I can deduce, today\\'s consensus is built on at least three things: \\n1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the\\nlong passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. \\nI don\\'t know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are\\norginally developed (does anyone?).\\n\\nBiblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.

As he said himself:\\n\\n   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in\\n   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_\\n   superficially_of_God\\'s_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God\\'s_will,_and_\\n   not_let_God\\'s_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]\\n\\n   For God\\'s will gave men their form, their essence, and their\\n   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the\\n   Lord\\'s creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be\\n   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every\\n   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who\\n   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his\\n   religious community and tries to butt into the other.\\n\\n   [...]\\n\\n   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will\\n   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_\\n   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]\\n\\n          -- Adolf Hitler, from \"Mein Kampf\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.\\n\\nOf course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief\\nwrong.  It\\'s also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \\nto believe in God.  We certainly can\\'t conclude that he\\'s an atheist, \\nthough.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The Bible proves it\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nIn the Bible it says that...\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed\\n\\'truth\\' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn\\'t to say that The\\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\\naccepted.\\n\\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\\nsubject to \"interpretation\", any claim that a passage \\'means\\' one thing and\\none thing only is not legitimate.\\n\\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\\n\\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Pascal\\'s Wager\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\\nbut if you don\\'t believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\\nhell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis argument is known as Pascal\\'s Wager.  It has several flaws.\\n\\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\\ndescribed as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y\\'s version of hell.\\n\\nSecondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\\nincorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you\\'re believing in\\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\\nfavour of prayer.\\n\\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \\nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \\ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \\nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\\n\\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \\nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \\ncost-benefit analysis.\\n\\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\\n\\n  1. One does not know whether God exists.\\n  2. Not believing in God is bad for one\\'s eternal soul if God does\\n     exist.\\n  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\\n  4. Therefore it is in one\\'s interest to believe in God.\\n\\nThere are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\\nconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\\nno \"cost\".\\n\\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\\nargument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\\nto believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\\nintended the argument to be viewed.\\n\\nThe biggest reason why Pascal\\'s wager is a failure is that if God is\\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\\na wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\\nwhether people believe in him.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: What is Occam\\'s Razor?\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nPeople keep talking about Occam\\'s Razor.  What is it?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam\\'s \\nRazor.  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \\nunnecessarily.\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\\n\\nNowadays when people refer to Occam\\'s Razor, they generally express it \\nmore generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\\n\\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \\nfor what we see around us:\\n\\n1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\\n\\n2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \\nthere is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \\nof non-zero complexity.\\n\\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam\\'s Razor might suggest \\nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\\n\\n3. There isn\\'t an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \\nWe just imagine that there is.\\n\\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \\nfind unacceptable.\\n \\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why it\\'s good to believe in Jesus\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nPreaching is not appreciated.\\n\\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\\nare on a \"conversion\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\\ntalk.religion.misc).\\n\\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\\nhave them do unto you!\\n\\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\\nanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\\nexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.\\n\\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you\\'re cleverer than him?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nEinstein did once comment that \"God does not play dice [with the universe]\". \\nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\\nChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein\\'s\\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,\\nEinstein\\'s religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\\n\\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\\n\"I believe in Spinoza\\'s God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\\nhuman beings.\"\\n\\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\\nstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,\\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\\n\\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\\nSymposium\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\\n\\n  \"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him\\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\\n   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a\\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\\n\\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\\n   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they\\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\\n   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\\n   more worthy task...\"\\n\\n\\n  \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a\\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\\n   science can reveal it.\"\\n\\nThe latter quote is from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen \\nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  \\nAlso from the same book:\\n\\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \\n   it.\"\\n\\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \\nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Everyone worships something\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nEveryone worships something, whether it\\'s money, power or God.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about\\nthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists\\' reactions to (for\\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists\\'.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\\nno smallest member.\\n\\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\\nany particular religion.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you\\ndon\\'t think all this appeared here just by chance?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\\n\\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\\n\\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\\nso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,\\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\\nuniverse and life on earth.\\n\\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\\nsurely it can\\'t have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \\nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\\ndeliberately.\\n\\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\\nposition.\\n\\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of \"If a creator created the universe,\\nwhat created the creator?\", but with the addition of spiralling \\nimprobability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\\ncreated and just \"is\" (or \"was\").\\n\\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\\njust \"is\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\\n\"A Brief History of Time\", explains his theory that the universe is closed\\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\\n\\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \\nWatchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\\nthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \\nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \\nuniverse too must have a creator.\\n\\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \\nthose common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \\nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \\ncreated the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \\nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\\n\\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \\nthe world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \\nreactor, we wouldn\\'t assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \\nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \\ndifferent part of creation.\\n\\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \\nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \\nstands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \\nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \\nrandom, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus \\ninternally inconsistent.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\\nevidence.  For example...\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\\nevidence.\\n\\nEarly versions of Josephus\\'s work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many\\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \"reconstructions\" of\\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\\n\\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\\nC.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as \\'the\\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.\\' It is Eusebius who is\\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\\n\\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\\nmore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently\\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nGodel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\\nBible to be both true and complete.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nGodel\\'s First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \\nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \\narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \\nvalid or invalid (\\'true\\' or \\'false\\') within that formal system.  (Technically\\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \\nsystem.)\\n\\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \"Liar \\nParadox.\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \"This \\nsentence is false.\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \\nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\\n\\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\\nthat Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\\n\\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. \\nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\\n\\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show\\nthat Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that\\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\\nwithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn\\'t tell us anything about\\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\\n\\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\\n\\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\\nboth consistent and universally applicable.

Sherman\\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\\nthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce\\nfederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the\\npresidential primary:\\n\\n RS: \"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\"\\n\\n GB: \"I guess I\\'m pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in\\n      God is important to me.\"\\n\\n RS: \"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of\\n      Americans who are atheists?\"\\n\\n GB: \"No, I don\\'t know that atheists should be considered as citizens,\\n      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under\\n      God.\"\\n\\n RS: \"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation\\n      of state and church?\"\\n\\n GB: \"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I\\'m just not\\n      very high on atheists.\"\\n\\nUPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were\\nstill angry over the remarks.\\n\\nThe exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,\\n1989.  It can also be found in \"Free Enquiry\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,\\nVolume 8, Number 4, page 16.\\n\\nOn October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,\\ncochairman of the Bush-Quayle \\'88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a\\nlawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School\\nDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to\\npledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \"one nation under God\"\\n(Bush\\'s phrase).  The following conversation took place:\\n \\n RS: \"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.\\n      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\"\\n \\n EM: \"It\\'s bullshit.\"\\n \\n RS: \"What is bullshit?\"\\n \\n EM: \"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\"\\n \\n RS: \"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush\\n      campaign is on this issue.\"\\n\\n EM: \"You\\'re welcome.\"\\n\\nAfter Bush\\'s election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract\\nhis statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the\\nPresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by\\n\\n  \"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports\\n   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or\\n   supported by the government.\"\\n\\nFor further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American\\nAtheist Press\\'s Cameron Road address.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: I know where hell is!\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI know where Hell is!

It was\\nrecently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the\\nquotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.\\n\\nThe person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul\\nGeneral at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of\\nChristianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there\\nis no Arabic version of that article to be found, it\\'s hard to say.\\n\\nIn 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the\\nquotation.\\n', '\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, when you crosspost to talk.origins, what do you expect?\\n', \"\\n/(hudson)\\n/If all morality were relative- big hairy deal.\\n\\nAs I said, you appear to be the only person saying that all morality\\nis relative.

He is the seal of all prophets\\ntill the day of judgement as stated in the Qur\\'an by Allah\\nSWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between\\n571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,\\nis a treason against Islam, against Qur\\'an, against the message\\nof Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another\\nmessenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.\\nHe is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his\\ncoming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur\\'an is from \\nChapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:\\n\\n\\tMuhammad is not the father of any of your men,\\n\\tbut (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal\\n\\tof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of\\n\\tall things.\\n\\n---------------------\\nCommentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,\\nit is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The \\nHoly Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.\\nAllah\\'s teaching is and will always be continuous, but there\\nhas been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later\\nages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not\\nan arbitrary matter.

In\\nfact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate\\nunbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise\\nOur\\'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His\\nmiracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) \\nsorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their\\nfollowers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the\\ncertainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars\\nof Islam) to the hundreth degree.\\n   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of\\nthe universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the\\neffect of the words,\\'You have indeed spoken the truth !\\'\\n   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,\\nwhile being observed by Him, \\'The true ruler has\\nappointed me to such and such position.  \\'At a time when\\nyou were asked to prove your claim, the word \\'Yes\\'\\nuttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if\\nthe ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your\\nrequest, this would confirm your claim even more soundly\\nand more definitely than would the word \\'Yes.\\'\\n   In the same way, ALLAH\\'s Most Noble Messenger\\nclaimed: \\'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this\\nuniverse.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken\\norder at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my\\nfingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five\\nspigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He\\nsplits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear\\nwitness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at\\nthis food: although it is barely enough for two or three\\nmen, it satisfies two or three hundred.  \\'Further he shows\\nhundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of\\nthe veracity of this high being and the proofs of his\\nprophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his\\ndeeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral\\nconduct and manners, his character and appearance\\nprove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.\\nIndeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the\\nfamous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief\\nmerely by seeing him, and said, \\'No lie can hide in this\\nface, nor can any fraud be found in it!\\'\\n   Although many of the  researchers have concluded\\nthat the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his\\nmiracles number about one thousand, there are\\nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of\\nhis prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of\\ntruth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions\\nhave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of\\nways.\\n   The Wise Our\\'an alone demonstrates thousands of\\nthe proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty\\naspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a\\nphenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of\\nindividuals who claimed prophethood and performed\\nmiracles have lived and passed away; then, the\\nprophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity\\nsuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For\\nwhatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the\\nmeans of the prophethood and messengership of all the\\nmessengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they\\nare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive\\nfashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and\\nmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the\\nperson of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found\\nin him with more certanity than all the other prophets.\\n', \"\\nI would hardly consider the BD's to be Christian.

Even the usages of the\\nword \"value\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard\\nof measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its\\nbasis in values, and so your statement above fails.

God's laws were originally written for \\nthe Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to\\nall people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of\\nHeaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made\\nobsolete by Jesus.\\n\\nIf anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the\\nfollowing verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon\\nthe Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He\\nalso reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived\\ninterpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their\\nheads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness\\nmust surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom\\nof Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their\\nway to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.\\nThey had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the\\nletter of the Law but never really believed in it.  \\n\\nI think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of\\nmodern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\\nin it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?\\n\\nChristianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's\\nperspectives and personal conduct.

For sanity\\'s sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all,\\nthat His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes \\nthrough immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex \\ncanon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another, \\nor is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free\\nto interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God\\'s message is indeed\\nmediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under-\\nstands the mediated message fully and clearly.  Since the responsibility \\nfor understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that \\nGod in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source \\nfor that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink. \\n \\n \\n \\nYour example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality\\nand politeness.  You might have said \"burp\", for burping and swearing carry\\nabout the same stigma today.

Conceivably some moral codes\\ncould be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.

Mr. England wrote the \\nfollowing as part of a book review section in This People\\'s magazine (Spring \\n1993 edition):\\n\\n  \"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--\\n  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other \\n  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian \\n  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around\\n  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude\\n  those who don\\'t fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central\\n  defining characteristic of a good American might be \"one who doesn\\'t draw\\n  exclusive circles\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the \\n  central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to\\n  draw a circle around \"Mormon\" or \"Christian,\" to decide who is \"orthodox\"\\n  and who isn\\'t by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider\\n  that the central pillar of Christ\\'s \"orthodoxy\" is our ability to love\\n  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.\\n\\n  \"I recently spent some time in a \"Christian\" bookstore in California. The\\n  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and\\n  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural\\n  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.\\n  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking \\n  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American\\n  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \"Cults and the\\n  Occult,\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same\\n  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found\\n  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers\\n  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous\\n  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations\\n  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).\\n\\n  \"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to\\n  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\"Perfect\\n  love casteth out fear,\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the\\n  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a \\n  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the\\n  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive\\n  action---as the \"religious right wing\" has launched this year against the\\n  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don\\'t like.\\n  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the\\n  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,\\n  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons\\' rights along with those of\\n  others they believe to be evil.\"\\n\\n\\nThe above \"sermon\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe\\nto This People\\'s magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who\\nrely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His\\narms.  \\n\\nEven though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles \\nof the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim \\nperfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do \\nnow lead the Church.

The most serious is that the\\nLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\\nnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\\nbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesus\\' death was what to do\\nabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\\nimpose the Law on them didn\\'t say that the Law was abolished.  It\\nsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn\\'t apply to Gentiles.  This\\nis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\\n(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\\nin Acts 15.)\\n\\nHowever there\\'s more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul\\'s apparent\\nrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus\\' commendation of\\nthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\\npurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\\nissue isn\\'t one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\\ndiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\\nassures us that that\\'s not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\\nthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\\nsinfulness.  But ultimately it\\'s an impossible standard, and one that\\nhas been superceded by Christ.  Paul\\'s comments are not the world\\'s\\nclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\\ninteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\\nnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\\nuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\\nFor its purpose of convicting of sin, it\\'s important that it not be\\nrelaxed.  However for Christians, it\\'s not the end -- ultimately we\\nlive in faith, not Law.\\n\\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\\nbut in fact that\\'s not Jesus\\' approach.  Jesus\\' interpretations\\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\\nPaul\\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\\n\\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\\nresponding to specific situations, he\\'s looking at the aspect of the\\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\\nto give Paul so much trouble.', \"\\n\\n\\nBobby, there's a question here that I just HAVE to ask.

Those scholars did indeed have an excellent\\nreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I\\nrecently checked several Lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nA couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", and a couple were more explicit \\nand stated that \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill yourself by hanging.\" A\\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \"apacgw\" is\\n\"strangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\\nsuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best\\nreferences though, \"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New\\nTestament,\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\\nfurther context).  \\n\\nThe word \"apagchw\" has two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and\\nthe root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" This root words is included in\\nwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\\ngreek word \"apagello\" means to send a message).  \"Apo\" can also denote a\\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson\\nspecifically makes comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which means \"to kill.\"\\nIn literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle to put out\\nof the way,\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\\nlife, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" does mean \"to hang,\" it\\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he\\nstate that it means \"to hang oneself, to end one\\'s life by hanging.\" He then\\nnotes the the use of \"apacgw\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\\npresents that example of \"apacgw\" as being used to explicitly mean \"suicide by\\nhanging.\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\\nadded denotation of \"death,\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by\\nGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\\nmeaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" was used, then death is\\ndenoted as the result). \\n\\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \"apacgw\":\\n\\n\\nNote Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to\\nGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\" the the\\nHebrew say \"and died\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. \\nIt should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \"and died\", the\\ncorrect translation would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did indeed die from\\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\\nSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\\nexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it\\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\\nyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\\n\"apacgw\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless\\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \\n\\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,\\nI think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or\\nhistorical source to justify it. \\n\\nBy the way, as to Mr Rose\\'s statement about trees around the Potter\\'s Field:\\n\\n\\nUnless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \\n\\nNow as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same\\nas the 30 silvers:\\n\\n\\nTrue, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas\\' betrayal\\n\"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas\\'\\nactions \"an iniquity\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took\\n\\n    \"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling\\n     him \"Buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give something\\n     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\\n     it was night.\"\\n\\nNote that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money\\nbox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\\nthe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \\n\\nOf course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\\nevidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas\\' hanging was\\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\\nMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\\nPassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\\nthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\\nthat night as well, and thus couldn\\'t have spent that either.  Oh dear, I\\nbelieve that the house of cards is comming down). \\n\\nMaybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on\\nFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.\\n\\nBy the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter\\'s field came from (ie: the\\nmention of it in Matthew), you say:\\n\\n\\nI am reminding you now to discuss it now. It\\'s all part of the same verse we\\nare discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping \\nthese issues.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n\\tA wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid Hume, Philosopher\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding', '\\n\\nReally>`?\\n\\n\\nNo, gravity is an inherent system.  You don\\'t need any excess information\\nother than observations to determine anything.  It is possible to objectively\\ndetermine someone\\'s guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system.\\nI agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that\\neverything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that\\nit cannot be objective in theory.\\n\\n\\nPerhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before,\\nthe practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likely\\nthe only ones to be considered \"immoral\" under the previous \"definitions\"\\nof the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since the\\nclass of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.\\n\\n\\nIt seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system\\nbecause perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which would\\nnecessitate some sort of grand design?\\n\\n\\nI think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired\\nbehaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive,\\nor destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is,\\nimmoral to what end?).', '\\nActually, jon, that is quite true.  Christian people have caused\\n\"objective morality\" to look very \"relative.\"  After all, that was the\\npoint of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out\\nChristianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own\\nprinciples?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this\\napparent inconsistency from at least one Christian\\'s viewpoint:\\n\\nIf God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then\\nHe has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick\\nphysically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \"objective\" morality for us.\\nThat is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or\\ndetrimental to) the creature He created. \\n\\n\\tGalatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in\\n\\tChrist Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared\\n\\tbeforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.\\n\\nHowever, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees\\nof the Bible,) God\\'s morality cannot be completely codified in a list\\nof rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a\\nperson\\'s life creates a new situation to which morality must be\\napplied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God\\'s\\n\"objective\" morality for us. \\n\\nThroughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of\\nrules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have\\nboth principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the\\nprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.\\nVolumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the\\napplication of the principles.  We [mankind] weren\\'t comfortable with\\nthe \"subjectivity\" of principles. \\n\\n\\tFor reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference\\n\\tbetween the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in\\n\\tverses 21-22:  \"You have heard that the ancients were told,\\n\\t\\'You shall not commit murder\\'...and \\'Whoever commits murder shall\\n\\tbe liable to the court.\\'  But I say to you that everyone who is\\n\\tangry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\"\\n\\nThe \"objective morality\" of God gets blurred by our inept\\ninterpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors\\nwhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY\\nwhat God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to\\nseeking God\\'s will instead of trying to prove we already had it all\\nfigured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God\\'s\\n\"objective morality\" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he\\nwas/is (and that\\'s the fundamental question,) then HE IS \"objective\\nmorality.\" ', '\\nThen Mr Mozumder is incorrect when he says that when committing\\nbad acts, people temporarily become atheists?', '[...]\\n\\nWait a minute.

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \\nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \\nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\\n\\nBut first let me say the following.\\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it\\'s rather pointless\\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\\nI\\'m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it\\'s\\n\\'usual sense\\' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\\nGod\".\\n \\nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith.

When you say\\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \\npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \\ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\\nmisguided.

I choose the\\nroads I travel, and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of\\nany given road or turn back -- and as long as I don\\'t *always* turn\\nback, there\\'s no shame in it.

And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too.  But that\\'s easy\\nto say from our \"enlightened\" viewpoint here in the 90\\'s, right?  Back\\nthen, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.\\nAfter all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of \\nthousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and \\nmillions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and \\nother people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.

Or do you mean that this applies to the allies\\nas well??\\n\\n\\nI make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the\\nWest before the war.  It is evident that the West, especially America,\\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and \\nthreatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world\\'s\\noil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been\\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\\nresponsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a\\nstrong response from the West was required.\\n\\n\\nWell, it\\'s not very \"loving\" to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up\\nnearby countries and keep them.  Or to allow them to continue with mass\\nslaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I\\'d have to\\nsay yes, stopping Hussein was the most \"loving\" thing to do for the\\nmost people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.\\n\\nI mentioned it.\\n\\nIf we hadn\\'t intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would\\nhave been appeasement.  It is precisely the lessons the world learned\\nin WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take\\nAustria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting\\nHussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to\\nprotect Saudi Arabia.\\n\\n\\nSure.  What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in\\nhis grandiose quest for a \"Thousand Year Reich\".  The consequences\\nstemmed from that.\\n\\nWhat should I say about them?  Anything in particular?\\n\\n\\n\\nSo?  It was the *policemen* on trial not Rodney King!!  And under American\\nlaw they deserved a jury of *their* peers!  If there had been black\\nofficers involved, I\\'m sure their would have been black jurors too.\\nThis point (of allegedly racial motivations) is really shallow.\\n\\n\\nSo?  It\\'s \"hard to imagine\"?  So when has Argument from Incredulity\\ngained acceptance from the revered author of \"Constructing a Logical\\nArgument\"?  Can we expect another revision soon??  :)  (Just kidding.)\\n\\n\\nI have to admit that I wonder this too.  But *neither* the prosecution\\nnor the defense is talking.  So one cannot conclude either way due to\\nthe silence of the principals.  \\n\\n\\nOK.  It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved.\\nAnd frankly, the original \"not guilty\" verdict baffled me too.  But then\\nI learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict\\non a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably\\nwould have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated\\nassault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which\\nnews commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California\\nlaw.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it\\'s evident that \\nthe first jury decided that the officers were \"not guilty\".  Note, \\nnot \"not guilty\" of doing wrong, but \"not guilty\" of aggravated assault \\nwith the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the \\nprosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a \\nverdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.\\n\\nIf the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then\\nI feel the \"not guilty\" verdict was a reasonable one.\\n\\n\\nThanks mathew, I like the quote.

I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\\nand is well referenced. \\n\\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\\n\\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \\nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\\n\\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\\n\\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.

I guess this is where\\nFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.\\n\\n\\nNo. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple\\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\\nthe child that it is \"wrong\".

The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"\\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\\nyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive\\nas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.\\n\\nDavid.\\n\\n---\\nOn religion:', 'The recent rise of nostalgia in this group, combined with the\\n  incredible level of utter bullshit, has prompted me to comb\\n  through my archives and pull out some of \"The Best of Alt.Atheism\"\\n  for your reading pleasure.

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew\\'s main\\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\\nwill take particular claims at face value.\\n\\nImmanuel:\\n\\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\\n\\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\\n       Joseph, will name him \\'Jesus\\' (which means G\\'d is\\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\\n       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\\n       spoken by a prophet:\\n\\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\\n       lord G\\'d said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \\n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G\\'d your lord.  It\\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\\n       Ahaz said, \"I won\\'t ask; I will not put the lord to a\\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G\\'d is with us.\"   He will\\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\\n       you dread will have been deserted...\\n\\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \\nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\\nlater Christians to be G\\'d walking among men, was never called by\\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\\n\\nEgypt:\\n\\n       After Jesus\\'s birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\\n\\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\\n\\n\\nWhat the lord really said was this.\\n\\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \\n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba\\'als, and kept burning\\n       incense to idols.\\n\\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea\\'s oracle.  But, it\\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G\\'d.   Again, this prophecy\\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\\n\\nRachel Weeps:\\n\\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\\n\\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\\n       no more.\"   \\n\\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \\nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus\\'s life to enhance\\nthe message of the church\\'s gospel.\\n       Because of the whole story\\'s similarity to the tale of the\\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G\\'d\\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\\nwould not suit Matthew\\'s purpose, as the children he speaks of are\\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\\nconvincing.\\n\\nThe Nazarene:\\n\\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \\n\\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\\n\\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \\nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson\\'s mother that\\nshe will,\\n\\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\\n\\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G\\'d. \\nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\\nsimple making them up now.\\n\\nBearing our\\nDiseases:\\n\\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\\nand disabilities.\\n\\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\\n       diseases.\"\\n\\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\\n\\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\\n\\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\\nof Israel, Jehovah\\'s chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\\ninstrument of the nations\\' salvation by G\\'d.\\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew\\'s parallel\\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\\n\\n\\nSilent Messiah:\\n\\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn\\'t arouse\\nthe attention of the local rulers.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \\n\\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\\n       name.\"\\n\\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\\n\\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\\n       await his law.\\n\\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\\nG\\'d there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\\nbe the children of G\\'d.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew\\'s attempt at\\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\\n\\nThree Days and\\nThree Nights:\\n\\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\\nresurrection.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\\n       three nights.\\n\\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \\n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn\\'t forget that\\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\\n\\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew\\'s little\\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\\ngod\\'s mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\\n\\nHearing &\\nUnderstanding:\\n\\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\\n\\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \\n\\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\\n       people\\'s heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\\n       them.\"\\n\\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \\nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G\\'d,\\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\\n\\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G\\'d said, \"Go, and say to this\\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\\n       see, but do not perceive.\\'   Make the heart of this\\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G\\'ds take men far\\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\\n       stump.\\n\\nHere we see that it is really G\\'d who causes the people of Israel\\nto stop listening to the prophet\\'s warnings, but reaffirms the\\npromise made to Solomon\\'s (and David\\'s) seed/lineage.  If you read\\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\\nof G\\'d to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\\nof Isaiah\\'s verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn\\'t\\nunderstand Jesus\\'s stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah\\'s verses are\\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G\\'d to him, in the\\npresent.   Once again, Matthew\\'s prophecy falls flat on its face. \\n\\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus\\'s parables look like they\\nhave the prophetic approval.\\n\\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\\n       foundation of the world.\"\\n\\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \\n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\\n       lord...\\n\\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\\nof Matthew\\'s gospel even inserted Isaiah\\'s name as this prophet. \\nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\\nof it up.\\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \\nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \\nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\\nMatthew\\'s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew\\'s prophecies aren\\'t the\\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\\n\\n\\nExcuses of\\nLittle Faith:\\n\\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\\nthey didn\\'t have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\\nwoman\\'s arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\\n\\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \\n\\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don\\'t get to see\\nGod anymore.\\n\\n       We\\'re too lazy; we\\'re not zealous enough; we\\'re\\n       sinful; it\\'s just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\\n       own demands on G\\'d\\'s appearance; if we had the right\\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G\\'d on his terms...\\n\\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G\\'d.  You, dear\\nreader, have not seen G\\'d.  Not literally, you know that to be\\ntrue. (I know that\\'s presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we\\'ve seen religions do is\\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G\\'d.  They say\\nour little faith does not merit us to see G\\'d.  Sometimes, they\\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\\nlives of people change... that is seeing G\\'d.\"   Thus people get\\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G\\'d into the everyday\\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G\\'d as I am speaking of... it is\\nnot seeing G\\'d the way people used to see.  \\n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\\nhas little faith.\\n\\x0c\\nJesus Rides on\\nan Ass:\\n\\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\\nJerusalem.  \\n\\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\\n       by the prophet, saying,\\n\\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\\n       ass-colt.\"\\n\\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\\ndifferently.\\n\\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew\\'s version, we get a\\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\\n\\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\\n\\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven\\'t you read?  `Out of the mouth of\\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.\\'\\n\\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\\nfit Matthew\\'s track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\\nMatthew, \"Haven\\'t you read?\" for the source reads,\\n\\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\\n       enemy and the avenger.\\n\\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G\\'d,\\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\\njust one more case of Matthew\\'s pen making up convenient prophetic\\nscripture.\\n\\nYHVH said to \\nmy lord...:\\n\\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\\n\\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\\n\\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\\nnature of the messiah-king.  It\\'s tempting to believe this, if one\\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \\nBut, there are problems.\\n       In Jesus\\'s time, the psalm was thought to be about the\\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David\\'s\\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus\\'s time had\\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\\nhis audience, who thought the messiah\\'s advent was imminent, and\\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\\n\\n       YHVH\\'s utterance to my lord:\\n\\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\\n       footstool.\"\\n\\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\\n       holy mountains.  \\n\\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\\n       forever.\"\\n\\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G\\'d.  It is merely an\\naddress of respect.  \\n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\\npoet, about David\\'s covenant and endorsement from G\\'d.  If the\\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\\nfrom David, was not present in David\\'s age.  We have extensive\\ntales of David\\'s doings and sayings-- none of which include any\\npraises of a messiah.\\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G\\'d had put his show of\\nfavour for David\\'s kingdom on hold.  \\n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\\npromised by G\\'d a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \\nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus\\'s question.  As we\\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\\n\\nMoses & Jesus,\\nHad it Together\\nAll Along...:\\n\\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\\npseudo-prophecy in John\\'s gospel.  The gospel story of John\\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\\nfrom the real events of Jesus\\'s career as told by even Matthew. \\nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\\nby G\\'d.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\\n\\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\\n\\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \\nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\\nwhich corresponds to John\\'s little prophecy.  It is par for the\\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\\nstill cling to it.\\n\\nThe Potter\\'s\\nField:\\n\\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn\\'t lawful for\\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter\\'s field with it to\\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\\n\\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter\\'s\\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\\n\\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\\nMatthew makes use of.\\n\\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\\n       YHVH.\\n\\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\\nof the messiah, or of G\\'d.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\\nshortly before G\\'d would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\\nMatthew\\'s quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah\\'s context, whereas \"potter\\'s\\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\\nMatthew\\'s track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\\nintentional dishonesty.\\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas\\'s situation, and if\\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew\\'s work is convincing\\nenough.\\n\\nWine, Vinegar,\\n& Casting Lots:\\n\\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\\n\\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\\n\\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\\n\\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\\n\\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\\n\\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\\n       Book of the Living.\\n\\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\\npsalm asks G\\'d for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\\nJesus of the gospels says,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\\n       don\\'t know what they do!\"\\n\\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus\\'s drink, not his\\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\\n\\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\\nsay that the fact that Jesus\\'s clothes were divided as told is no\\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\\nJesus\\'s clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\\nsuspicions.\\n\\nThe 22nd Psalm:\\n\\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\\nwill examine the primary passages.\\n\\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \\n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\\n       don\\'t answer, and by night, but find no rest.\\n\\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \\nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn\\'t do much\\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\\nboth day and night on the cross.\\n\\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \\n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\\n\\nThis seems to fit Jesus\\'s execution pretty well, with the\\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\\n\\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\\n\\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\\n\\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\\n\\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I\\'m sure the early Christian\\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\\n\\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\\n       hands and feet...\\n\\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka\\'ari),\\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka\\'aru.\"   But, to\\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\\ntranslators.\\n\\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\\npsalm\\'s true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\\nthe forearms.  This doesn\\'t say much in favour of the traditional\\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren\\'t bound by our religious beliefs.\\n\\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\\ninterpretations of Jesus\\'s life and death.  How much these\\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\\nthings for St. Matthew.\\n\\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus\\'s\\ncrucifixion.  John\\'s gospel recount, written about 70 years after\\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus\\'s execution,\\n\\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\\n       \"The will look on him whom they\\'ve pierced.\"\\n\\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\\nthem.\\n\\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\\n\\nJohn\\'s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\\nMatthew\\'s attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\\nthan just one passage.  John\\'s errors are grossly obvious and\\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\\nreligion were founded.\\n\\n\\x0c\\nReckoned with\\nTransgressors:\\n\\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\\n\\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\\n\\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\\n\\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\\n\\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\\n       with him railed, \"Aren\\'t you the messiah?! Save\\n       yourself, and us!\"\\n\\nThis certainly fits with Mark\\'s recount, which tells how the\\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\\n\\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\\n       \"Don\\'t you fear G\\'d, since you are under the same\\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \\n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \\n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\\n\\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\\napparently noble and of principle, doesn\\'t seem likely to have\\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\\nLuke.  Of course, Luke\\'s recount also disagrees with Mark\\'s.  \\nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\\nwords of G\\'d do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\\nseen.\\n\\nThe End of the\\nWorld--\\n       Mt. 24:\\n\\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\\nwhich he has been warning about.\\n\\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple\\'s\\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\\n\\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \\n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\\n       the mountains.\\n\\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\\n       pass away until all these things take place...\\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\\n       at an hour you do not expect.\\n\\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\\nthem that although he doesn\\'t know the exact day or hour, that it\\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \\nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\\nswept away.\\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \\nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\\nhe didn\\'t learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \\nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\\nat the Apostles\\' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\\n\\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \\nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\\njust the right moment to spring?\\n\\n\\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn\\'t in the best\\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \\nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\\naccepted.

This is often\\ninterpreted as the much weaker term religion. \\n\\nThe atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews,\\nMushriqin, Christians, etc. because the  latter are all din. To have a\\ndin you need a set of beliefs, assumptions, etc, to forma a social\\ncode. For example the Marxist have those, such as History, Conflict,\\netc. That they do not put idols (sometimes they did) to represent\\nthose assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the other\\nMushriq, or roughly polytheists. \\n\\nThere cannot be social Atheism, because when there is a community,\\nthat community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate \\nthe society. When they inscribe assumptions, say Nation, or \"Progress is \\nthe natural consequence of Human activity\" or \"parlamentarian\\ndemocracy is doubtlessly the best way of government\", however \\nthey individually insist they do not have gods, from the Quranic point\\nof view they do. Therefore by definition, atheism does not exist. \\n\"We are a atheist society\" in fact means \"we reject the din other than\\nours\". \\n\\nAtheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/\\nsuppositions/.. of the society that they part, and in that case that\\nis a personal deviation of belief, and Quran tells about such\\ndeviations and disbelief.

The scenario you outline is reasonably \\nconsistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does\\nnot support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by\\nlatest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for\\nabout 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at\\nmost) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life\\nhas been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before\\nthere were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...\\nmostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just\\nfossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows\\nthat disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what\\nbrought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then\\nhow could it exist before humans?\\n\\n[deletions]\\n\\n Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about\\nbiology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There\\nis no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off'\\nin perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a\\ncollective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the\\ndegeneration of the genetic code'.\\n\\n\\n Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and\\nbacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is\\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But\\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as\\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\\nthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible\\ndied off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed',\\n(forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and\\ndied off for lack of nearby hosts.\\n I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few\\nhundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to\\nbe getting less nasty w/age...\\n\\n\\n Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?\\nAnd, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It\\nseems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift\\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\\n\\n\\n Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the\\nphrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect'\\nsystem would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system\\nthat will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a\\nperfect system. At least, IMHO.\\n Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a\\nbunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the\\noriginal genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in\\ninferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?\\nIf so, why could God not have used better materials?\\n Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself,\\nof did It just choose not to?\\n\\n[deletions]\\n\\n My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for\\nthe explanation you give.

Being forced to leave the \\nGarden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.\\n\\nLessons from Traditional Interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.\\n2.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\\n: be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.\\n\\nThis definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However,\\nI (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or\\nspiritual explanations. \\n\\nIt makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood\\nas natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not\\nrequire us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual,\\nfor that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science.\\nHowever, science has one advantage theology doesn\\'t: it is self-\\ncorrecting, with nature as its judge. \\n\\nIt is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self-\\nconsistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer\\na bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to\\npsychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe\\nfrom its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.\\n\\n There is no need\\n: for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\n: no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\n: physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\n: determnined.\\n\\nActually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question,\\nand science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow\\nsuperdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have\\nany meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent\\nfree will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their\\nperspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free\\nwill or not? \\n\\n: This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\n: its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\n: acquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident.\\n\\nMaybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when\\nduring the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control\\none third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of \\nnumerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates\\nand preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same\\nprinciple - only the systems that can start replicating will\\nsurvive, those which don\\'t don\\'t make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)\\n\\n: For an atheist, no\\n: event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\n: value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\n: an event can have value. \\n\\nFrom whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from\\nmy perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have\\na perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective\\nperspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if\\nI think about what it would it be like in their position, I will\\neventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily\\na gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.\\nPerhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity\\nis helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect\\nothers who seem to have identity, too. \\n\\nBill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)\\nfor starters.\\n\\n: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\n: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\n: what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\n: seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\n: have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\n: in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\n: establish your values.\\n\\nC.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why\\nhe abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is\\nseverely flawed.\\n\\nSome values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some\\nothers, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its\\nroots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real\\npossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic\\nbehaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better\\nand better in building and using tools, they also became better\\nat killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could\\nonly favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one\\'s\\nown people.\\n\\nThe Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews\\nwas not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people\\ntogether, under one god. Their god did not care much about people\\nof other nations. \\n\\nAt the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews\\nwere under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore\\nthe Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along\\nwith it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)\\n\\n: Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\n: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\n: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\n: way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\n: objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n: - that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\n: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\n: no weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\n\\nIt looks like you haven\\'t bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there\\nis an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may \\nvalue its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result\\nof some physical event), and other\\'s happiness, too, if the observer\\ncomes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,\\nwithout any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their\\nmeaning. \\n\\nIt is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of\\nview. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ \\npersonal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths\\ndo not exist. \\n\\nThe fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others\\nis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence\\nby becoming social beings who can think and value others\\'\\nexistence.\\n\\nMorality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and\\nmany other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have\\nsometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. \\n\\n: That you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\n: or God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\n: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\n: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\n: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\n: conditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\n: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\n\\nThe last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is\\nevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very\\nwell, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism\\nis still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.\\n\\nYou are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective\\npoint of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,\\n_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,\\nhas its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point\\nof view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not\\ncease to be subjective. \\n\\nFrom a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither\\ndoes pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are \\ninherently subjective. \\n\\nOnce again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even\\nto make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if\\nwe don\\'t, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come\\nfrom any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than\\nto make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god\\ngave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my\\nfault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the\\npoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one\\'s\\nown and then to get mad at this. \\n\\nGod must be schizophrenic.\\n\\n: All of this being so, you have excluded\\n: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\n: etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\\n: weight whatsoever.\\n\\nNeither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand\\nwhy a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way\\nless credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.\\n\\nBill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being,\\n_including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint, it is his\\nown point of view, and his morals are his own. \\n\\nPetri\\n', 'I posted this several days ago for Dave Butler.

However, I see no problem in Tony Rose\\'s\\nexplanation of Judas\\' death...\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n \\nHOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING\\nHIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\"\\n=============================================================\\n \\nThis question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are\\nconstantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent\\ndiscrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.\\nSome have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is\\ndestroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at\\nall.\\nMatthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and\\nwas crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do\\nthey necessarily contradict each other?\\nMatthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that\\nJudas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling\\nsomething black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be\\ntrue and supplementary.\\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\\nthis way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are\\nnot told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced\\nwas the decomposition of his body before his fall.\\nLouis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.\\nThis individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a\\npistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at\\nthe same time.\\nOn the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting\\nhimself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping\\nform the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the\\ncase of Matthew\\'s and Peter\\'s accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a\\nsituation of different perspectives of the same event.\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n \\nYour only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit\\ninerrancy.  You haven\\'t related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.\\nHere\\'s what you said in an earlier post...\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\nDB [quoting Tony Rose]...\\n \\n\"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so\\nopposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.

You can say\\nit\\'s a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn\\'t tell me it\\ndidn\\'t happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.\\n \\nQuestions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or\\nare either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an\\nalleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe\\nin this respect.\\n \\nDB...\\n\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:\\n \\n \\nActually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer\\nit because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out\\nthat hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a\\nbit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy\\nmovies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nI work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a\\ncall re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother\\nis on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child\\'s psych ward at a\\nlocal hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.\\n \\nTo assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is\\n\"begging the question\", if I may quote you.\\n \\n[Last night, listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast, The Christian\\nResearch Institute\\'s show, one of the scholars on there used several of these\\nterms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM\\nshow teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]\\n \\nDB...\\n\"This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other\\nqualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nQualifiers are important at times, as we\\'ll see in an OT passage I\\'ll mention\\nbelow.\\nDoes hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we\\nhave re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it\\'s\\nsynonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But\\nhe lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can\\ndiscover.\\n \\nDB...\\n\"Now I am not alone in this thought; in fact, since Mr DeCenso so respects\\nChristian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nThank you, Dave.\\n \\nDB...\\n\"Interestingly, not one of the Christian references I read, interpreted the\\nhanging as being anything but a fatal suicide.              ^^^^^^^^^^^\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\n[^^^ above, mine]\\nSo it\\'s OK to use Christian sources to back your points?

But the chief priests took the silver pieces and\\nsaid, \"It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the\\nprice of blood.\" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter\\'s\\nfield, to bury strangers in.

One\\nsimply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew\\'s version as\\nthe correct version in both Matt and Acts.  \"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\"\\nsuggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly\\nexploded (which doesn\\'t explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope\\nbroke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn\\'t explain\\nhow a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nThe outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person\\nwas suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may\\nhave deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell\\nupon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a\\nsuperficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not\\ngiven a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted\\npost gave us some...\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\\nthis way down, tearing his body open.\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n \\nDB...\\nNow truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the\\nsource of the Potter\\'s field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is\\ncorrect: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist\\nwho claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to\\nthereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the\\nprophesy of the Potter\\'s field came from).\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nPlease, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss\\nthis with you.\\n \\nDB...\\nAs to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\\nmoney with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\\nthan some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\\nmention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\\nwhat act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning\\nJudas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out\\nthat when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\\ndiscusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\\nit was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nDave, we are getting somewhere, aren\\'t we!\\n \\nACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples\\n(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,\\nACT 1:16 \"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy\\nSpirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide\\nto those who arrested Jesus;\\nACT 1:17 \"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\"\\nACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and\\nfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\\nACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field\\nis called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)\\nACT 1:20 \"For it is written in the book of Psalms: \\'Let his dwelling place be\\ndesolate, And let no one live in it\\'; and, \\'Let another take his office.\\'\\n \\nNotice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states\\nthat Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\".\\nBut the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and\\nobtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\\n         ^^^^^^\\nJOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a\\nthief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.\\nJOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had\\nsaid to him, \"Buy those things we need for the feast,\" or that he should give\\nsomething to the poor.\\n \\nSo, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.\\nRight after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,\\naccording to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of \"wages of\\niniquity\" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen\\nby Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical\\nexplanation of what the \"wages of iniquity\" are.  What do you think, Dave?\\n \\nDB...\\n\"Now since I have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you\\ncould unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking\\nme what type I think you are, as you did to Mr Joslin).\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nI will gladly admit that I am a Complete Inerrantist, although I do not have\\nthat big a problem with the Limited Inerrancy view.\\n\\nFrank', \"\\nDo you consider Neo-Nazis and white supremists to be Christian?

Michael\\nSiemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution\\nof an argument over them turns on secular and cultural\\nassumptions that are independent of these rules.\\n \\n\\nThe commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,\\nin part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if\\nhe has \"ultimate responsibility.\" Indeed, many traditions present\\nan interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret\\nloving one\\'s neighbor as following various other rules, and\\nrelying on their god to make things come out right, precisely\\nbecause it would be wrong for man to assume such \"ultimate\\nresponsibility.\" Once again, we are confronted with good sounding\\ngoo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. \\n\\n\\nAnd who is to say that this interpretation is \"twisted\"?  There\\nare many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\\nreading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\\nMichael cannot refer to \"base\" claims or base commandments to\\nshow that such readings are \"twisted,\" because this divergence in\\nunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the \"base\"\\nclaims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,\\nMichael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions\\nthat these conservative Christians will reject.  \\n\\n\\nBut these base commandments are too vague to serve as  \"a\\nprinciple for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems.\" The meaning of\\nthese base commandments for any believer derives from the secular\\nand cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how\\nthe believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of\\nother Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,\\nor from some combination of these things.  These commandments\\nlack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for\\ncriticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from\\nthe ethical system the believer brings to these commandments. \\n\\n\\nJesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which\\nwould seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what\\nit means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many*\\nparables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are\\nstraightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline\\nepistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all\\ncome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,\\nthe problem is *not* a lack of raw material. \\n\\n-*----\\n\\nNo, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \\nseriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\\ngospel.\\n\\n\\nIn a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us\\nsomething about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament\\nauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve\\nas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the\\nnature of the Christian god and about what men should and\\nshouldn\\'t do. \\n\\nThe irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\\nse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\\ngays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is\\neffective only through the extra-Christian principles through\\nwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply\\nthe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to\\ntheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\\nmake Michael\\'s Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\\nbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\\nChristian interpretation.  \\n\\nMichael paints a picture of \"standard American atheism\" as the\\nrejection of the evil in many conservative Christian\\ninterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more\\ndamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents\\nsuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and\\nthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by\\nan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).

However, it was plain to me, that\\nthis consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the\\nKoran.  Take the flood, for example, the bible is full of detail,\\n(\"forty days and forty nights\", \"pair of every animal\", etc.), we all\\nknow this is nonsense.  The Koran\\'s description of the same event is\\nso obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as \"A big river \\nflooded for a few days and caused much damage\".  Yes, no contradiction\\nbut also not much fact.\\n\\nThe Koran might be consistent with modern science, but being\\nconsistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that\\ntime, does not seem much of an achievement.\\n\\nThe book concludes by saying something like, the Koran must have had\\ndivine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot\\nof (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe, and none of them\\ncan be found in the Koran!  Arguing for the greatness of a book by\\ntalking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme.\\n\\nThe above is, of course, from memory so I may have missed some points.\\n\\n\\n\\n-- ', '\\n\\nWell, I\\'ve said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is\\nobjectively a murder.  However, who is at blame is another question.\\nIt seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions--\\nrealizing the risks--is to blame.\\n\\n\\nYes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing\\nany raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally\\nfrom the rest of society because of this.\\n\\n\\nAnd I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent\\nperson will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact,\\nmany criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment\\nof innocents.\\n\\n\\nBut, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals\\non the road.  Again, the blame is on society.\\n\\n\\nYes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do\\nso much to prevent false witnesses.\\n\\n\\nOkay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not\\nall such \"murders\" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life\\nis wrong, no matter what the circumstances?\\n\\n\\nBut, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an\\ninnocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of\\nsociety shares this blame.  And, most people\\'s definitions of murder\\ninclude some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an\\nexecution, is it?\\n\\n\\nMurder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing\\nit at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the\\ninnocent victim is.\\n\\n\\nReading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction\\nwas moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth\\nmatters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That\\nis, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.\\n\\n\\nBut then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the\\nconviction was unfair.\\n\\n\\nYes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all\\npossible information), we can\\'t always determine the difference in our\\nflawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible,\\nbut it still isn\\'t objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn\\'t matter if\\nwe *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.\\n\\n\\nBut what we know has no effect on an objective system.\\n\\n\\nWhy are you so sure?\\n\\n\\nWhy is *your* reality important?\\n\\n\\nBut, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely.\\nAnd, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a\\ntotally ideal and objective system.\\n\\n\\nWell, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal.\\nWe can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to\\nthe ideal system as possible.\\n\\n\\nYes, we all bear the responsibility.

Roehm was a \\nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm\\'s homosexuality.\\n\\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \\npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \\nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself.

Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.\\nEnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in\\nmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our\\nenvironment.\\n \\nIncorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and\\ninitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to\\nCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and\\nObjectives:\\n \\n                           MISSION\\n \\n   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members\\n   to foster and implement the improved education of young\\n   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards\\n   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition\\n   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,\\n   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue\\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\\n   which we must all live.\\n \\n                         OBJECTIVES\\n \\n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\\n   objectives shall be:\\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\\n            focus the education and participatory\\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\\n            of environmental concern;\\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\\n            their branches a full complement of program\\n            materials for their use, including suitable\\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\\n            desirable;\\n       (3)  To serve as a \"clearing house\" for the exchange\\n            of program ideas, materials and information\\n            among said organizations;  and\\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate through three \"Program Divisions\" serving youth in\\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\\nthrough formation of \"EnviroLeague Teams,\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by\\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\\n \\nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\\nyouth membership.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\\n \\nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \"draft\"\\nportions of the Mentor\\'s Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\\nplace.\\n \\nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague\\'s founder chose this\\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\\nForums.\\n \\nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe\\'s Earth Forum - GO\\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \"EnviroLeague.\"\\n============================================================================\\n \\nSubsequently, EnviroLeague\\'s Initial Governance Council has held its first\\nmeeting.

After he and his brother Hyram\\n#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over\\n#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like\\n#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider\\n#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I\\'m led to understand.  Make\\n#no mistake, this was no messiah we\\'re talking about in Smith).  The\\n\\nAnd neither did he claim he was.

Many have tried\\nto explain the \"Smith phenomenon\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5\\nmillion member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith\\'s\\ntestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.\\n\\n#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed\\n#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only\\n#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have\\n#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The\\n#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn\\'t of much help\\n#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.\\n#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited\\n#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other\\n#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)\\n\\n\"The rest\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,\\nwhile the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various\\nauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new\\nprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and\\ndoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in\\nline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith\\'s vacancy: he was the senior\\napostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated\\nthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.\\n\\nOther rightful \"heirs\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated\\n(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,\\nJoseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty\\nland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This\\n\"Rekhabite\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated\\nby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.\\n\\nGranted, a couple of \"do-it-yourselfers\" stayed behind, unwilling to\\nsacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but\\nthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The\\nchurch benefitted from this purification process: they became even\\nmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.\\n\\n#        Both sects practiced the \"1-year food stockpile\" doctrine,\\n#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at\\n#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a\\n#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than\\n#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a\\n#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite\\n#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,\\n#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people\\n#had nobody to turn to save themselves.\\n#\\n#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.\\n\\nBTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of\\nthe largest denominations in the country) a \"sect\"???  It didn\\'t \"splinter\"\\nfrom any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.\\n\\n#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very\\n#>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They\\'re pledged to defend\\n#>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually\\n#>do - even to the point of suicide.)\\n\\nWhat a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I am\\nnot comfortable with this alleged \"cosiness\" with Mammon: I assure you\\nthat *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our\\nONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has\\nappointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about\\nsuicide and \"atone for sins with blood\") is yet another insulting\\nmisrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...\\n\\n#\\n#        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS\\n#and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts\\n#from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.

Though J.

Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I\\nam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes\\nof honor and conduct (that\\'s why they were selected for in the\\nfirst place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith\\nSTRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all\\npeople are free to worship \"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\"\\n\\n#        If it\\'s true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS\\n#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true\\n#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his\\n#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may\\n#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You\\n#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected\\n#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to\\n#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they\\n#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover\\n#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade\\n#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.\\n#These people are the \"salt of the Earth\" and as such are more\\n#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.\\n\\nA good explanation, I can accept that.

Both are \\n: as \"unnatural\" as each other.\\n\\nYet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists\\nfor procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. That\\nhomosexuals don\\'t procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and\\nnothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.\\n\\n: \\n: |> Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some\\n: |> policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that\\n: |> their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a\\n: |> choice that should be protected by law.

I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of\\naccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form\\nas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human\\nbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \"God\"\\nin near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:\\n\\nThe \"possibility that always exists\" is that I (or, to revert to proper\\ntime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could\\npersuade \"Christian B\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed\\nconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note\\nthat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian\\nargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]\\nprohibitions.\\n\\nWhat Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:\\n\\n\\tA.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved\\n\\t    in the Inquisition.\\n\\n\\tB.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however\\n\\t    painful this *seems*, \"discipline\" her children for their\\n\\t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or\\n\\t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example\\n\\t    \"deterring\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)\\n\\n\\tA.  I point out that this \"justification\" of a failure in love\\n\\t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of\\n\\t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.\\n\\n\\tB.  Burns me at the stake.\\n\\nMy rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is\\ngoing on here has a *lot* to do with \"cultural baggage.\"  In this case,\\nthe baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief\\nthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most\\nbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial\\npractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least\\ngreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion\\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\\n\\nMr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor\\'s B,\\nthen my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-\\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense\\nattorney.  So, \"one possibility\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in\\nmay others.  At the other extreme, the \"persuasion\" will succeed when it\\nproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the\\nInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that\\nmany of the victims of Inquisition will have \"accepted\" that they were in\\nfact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty\\nof charges brought against them.)\\n\\nThe point is that the \"persuasion\" breaks down when the parties do NOT\\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\\nthrust of the Inquisition, against \"heresy\", it is *bound* to break down\\nin precisely the \"worst\" cases.  The \"conservative\" (I don\\'t think that\\nis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\\nthat he is \"justified\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to\\na \"greater good.\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\\nthe gospel, as if one\\'s theories about \"sin\" entitled one to cast aside\\nJesus\\' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).\\n\\nI am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\\n\\n\\nWell, the whole *point* of making these the \"base\" commandments is that\\nthey *aren\\'t* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a\\nlaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\\nto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\\npersonal involvement in and responsibility for one\\'s actions.  The Great\\nCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were\\nGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A\\ndemand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping\\nup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important\\nthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \"Conservatives\"\\nmay twist this \"act as if you were God\" to mean \"lay down rules for other\\npeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don\\'t keep YOUR rules.\"\\nThey are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\\nlot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy\\nIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \"against\\nGod\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \"conservatives\" have\\nconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other\\npeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard\\nAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.\\n\\n\\nAnd different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\\n*different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\\nit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\\n(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\\nIt does not have a QU\\'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\\nlittle, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\\nthe \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\\nthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))\\nfor their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus\\nspecifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\"\\n\\n\\t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson\\n\\t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that\\n\\t SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I\\'ll\\n\\t point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why\\n\\t there is a huge amount of \"cultural baggage\" involved.]\\n\\nYou are quite right that this is \"goo\" if one is looking for an ethical\\nsystem.\\n\\nBut why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\\nsociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?

Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\\nindeed \"chorion.\" \\n\\nNow I\\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\\n\\n\\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \\n\\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\\n\\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \\nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \\nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \\nthink it more likely that Mr Archer\\'s investigations into \"contradictions\" to \\nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \\nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \\nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\\nto support Mr Archer\\'s contentions). \\n\\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\\'s) is the definition of\\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\\nBullinger\\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\\nadmit how stupid Bullinger\\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\\nwhich drives the point home). \\n\\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \\nparticular issue closed.

It was the religion of the great Persian\\nEmpire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ\\nwas born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three\\nZoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,\\nJews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the\\nZoroastrian prophet.\\n\\n   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are \\na miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a\\npeople is very much on their minds.\\n\\n   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance\\nof the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed\\nby nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause\\ntheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.\\n\\n   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they\\nactually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children\\nbecome totally assimilated, they say, it\\'s their children - rather than\\nthe world at large - who will be the losers.\\n\\n   \"It\\'s important to have an identity,\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,\\na leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \"It\\'s important\\nfor everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.\\nYou don\\'t have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.\\nYou can fall back on your own identity.\"\\n\\n   For Zoroastrians, there\\'s much to be proud of.\\n\\n   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which\\nanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was\\nonly one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which\\ntranslates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.\\n\\n_Good vs. evil_\\n\\n   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with\\nthe good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for\\ngood, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences\\nsuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,\\nkindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of\\nmen and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.\\n\\n   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to\\nfollow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,\\nJoseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,\\ntraced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.\\n\\n   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a\\nstained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of\\nMount Hamilton, is \"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\"\\n\\n   So it\\'s not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,\\nwhere a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape\\npersecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;\\nthe overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.\\n\\n   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India\\nand Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from\\nIran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state\\nwhere others had no rights.\\n\\n   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \"good\\ndeeds\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,\\nthe recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because\\nManou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up\\ndowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple\\'s\\ndedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the\\nZoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.\\n\\n   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an\\nIranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples\\nin North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount\\nHamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,\\nand Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on\\nthis continent.\\n\\n   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the\\nproperty already had a large house that they have converted to a\\ncommunity center.\\n\\n   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet \\nZoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted \\nceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.\\n\\n   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-\\nin area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are \\nsometimes called \"fire worshippers,\" they actually consider fire just \\na symbol of God.  \"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the \\ncross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\" Bhujwala said.\\n\\n   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all\\nIranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of\\nthe season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With\\nZoroaster\\'s birthday just six days later, the combination of religious\\nand secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the\\nUnited States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.\\n\\n  For this year\\'s celebration of the prophet\\'s birthday, about 500 people\\ncame to worship and revel.\\n\\n   \"The good things in life are not forbidden,\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,\\na leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed\\nproved him right.\\n\\n   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood\\naround the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted\\nthanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking\\nsandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit\\nand nuts.\\n\\n   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \"People eat the\\nfruit,\" Tarapore said.  \"It\\'s a way to participate in the ceremony.\"\\n\\n_Santa Claus, sort of_\\n\\n   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.

Welbon)]\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFor many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an\\nepistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of\\nknowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence\\nof gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most\\nphilosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that\\nmust be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical\\nbasis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?\\n \\nThere is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence\\nof any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses\\nword \"on faith\", we just mean that having found this person to be\\nreliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now.\\nIf we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence\\neverywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about\\ngods?\\n \\nThe difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then\\none of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing,\\nrather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith\\nis in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable\\nbasis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at\\nother times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist\\nbelieves that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable\\nknowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than\\ntheism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other\\nknowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than\\nSanta Claus or the Easter Bunny?\\n \\nI would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn\\'t\\nrequire absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don\\'t believe that\\nthere is any such thing as absolute knowledge.

If this has already disappeared from your site,\\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\\nexcellent article.  \\n\\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\\n\\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\\ncompletely on the Qur\\'an and contains numerous Qur\\'anic verses and\\nhadiths to support its point of view.\\n\\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur\\'an\\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur\\'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\\ncourse not.\\n\\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\\nyou.  The Qur\\'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\\nonly an idiot would think so.\\n\\nDo you see my point?\\n\\n\\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \\ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\\n\\n\\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\\n\\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\\nIslam => lack of education and power.\\n\\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reasons for this situation.\\n\\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\\nfollowing the Qur\\'an or not.\\n\\n\\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur\\'an\"\\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\\nfact which contradicts your theory. \\n\\n\\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\\nthis.\\n\\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\\n\\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.

In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\\n\\nJ. L. MACKIE\\n\\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\\nformalistic and better written than Martin\\'s works, and refreshingly direct\\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\\n\\nJAMES A.

I would prefer any misc.taoism\\nto deal more closely with topics and works more closely associated\\nwith at least \"semi-orthodox\" Taoism: with established classic works \\ndefinitely included and works like Mantak Chia\\'s argued about! \\n\\nI think \"neo-Taoism\" should be excluded or get its own group (what I\\nmean by this is \"Humpty-Dumpty Taoism\", in which Taoism means whatever \\na poster says it means.) This \"alt.taoism\" could also be a refuge \\nfor debates about what \"Taoism *REALLY* means\" or speculations on sexual\\nalchemy, etc..\\n\\ne.g. (from Thyagi again):\\n\\nKent gloomily predicts (quoting from Thyagi\\'s article):\\n\\n\\nI think that discussions of this nature are not completely out of\\nplace. What\\'s happening is that that the term \"Taoism\" is becoming\\ncompletely polluted and trivialized like the words \"magic\", \"Alchemy\", \\n\"Zen,\" etc., by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they \\nwant. This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled \"The\\nTao of\" this, that, and everything else. (With respect to some exceptions\\nlike the books by Jou, Tsung-Hwa.)\\n\\nAny other comments/ideas? I look forward to seeing them.

God's laws were originally written for \\n: the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to\\n: all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of\\n: Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made\\n: obsolete by Jesus.\\n\\nJust for reference, here's the earlier quote:\\nMalcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9\\nand Deuteronomy 22:20-25:\\n: These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had\\n: expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a\\n: direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God\\n: is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately\\n: punishable.\\n: Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to\\n: God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in\\n: the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There\\n: is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And\\n: not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew\\n: and Gentile alike.\\n\\nThese are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the\\nother is a breach of logic.  I don't mind people shifting their position on\\nan issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change\\nwas made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus\\nchange that?\\n\\n: If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the\\n: following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon\\n: the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.\\n\\nSure he does this.  However, he doesn't address the notion of stoning\\nnon-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to\\ndeny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?\\n\\n: I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of\\n: modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\\n: in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?\\n\\nI'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible\\nfrom end to end and don't believe in it.  Depending on how they use this\\nknowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and\\nback it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David\\nKoresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don't know* if\\nthey actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly\\nmade the means look frightening.\\n\\nHowever, just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, but\\nbelieve every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far\\nmore of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easy\\nto manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don't know enough\\nto debate with these people.\\n\\n: Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's\\n: perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.\\n\\nNo, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told\\nme how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God's will\\nby doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to\\nobey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to\\ntwo millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it\\nwith my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing\\nthe will of God.\\n\\n: Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is\\n: their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.\\n\\nWell, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about\\neternal damnation for non-believers?  I see little respect eminating from\\nthe god of the Bible.  I see a selfish and spiteful god.\\n\\n: God be with you,\\n\\nNot yours, thanks ;)\\n\\n: Malcolm Lee  :)\\n\\nRob Lanphier\\nlanphi872@snake.cs.uidaho.edu\\nlanph872@uidaho.edu\\n\\nAnd for the curious, here is my earlier post:\", \"sandvik@newton.apple.com (Kent Sandvik) writes...\\n\\n\\n\\nKS, I see you're wanting Malcolm's response.

Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task.

These Greek words have totally different \\nmeanings.  The words are Hades, Tartaros, and Gehenna.\\n\\n    In bibical usage, the Greek word Hades is used only 11 times in the \\nNew Testament, and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol...\\nmeaning the grave or pit (compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10).  Hades may be \\nlikened to a hole in the ground. (In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire!)\\n\\n    Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell\\nto translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice.  \\n\\n    Why?  Because when seeing the word \"hell\" many readers impute to it the \\ntraditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never \\nremotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English!\\n\\n    In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of \\nthe dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of \\n\"shadowy realm.\"  Hades is simply the abode we call the grave.  All dead go to \\nthis hell.\\n\\n    The second \"hell\" of the Bible, Tartaros, is mentioned only once in \\nscripture, 2 Pet.2:4; \"For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast \\nthem down to hell (TARTAROS), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be \\nreserved unto judgment...\"\\n\\n    Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne (Isa.14:12-14; \\nRev.12:4), the archangel Lucifer (now Satan) and a third of the created angels \\n(now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18).  They were cast down to \\nTartaros, a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the \\nmutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (Jude 6; 1 Cor.6:3).\\n\\n    Tartaros, then, is a \"hell\" that applies only to evil, rebellious angels or\\ndemons (It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe \\nthe place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans).  Nowhere in the Bible \\nis there any mention of men being put into this particular \"hell\".\\n\\n    The the third word that is translated as \"hell\" in the Bible is Gehenna. It\\ncomes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning \"valley of Hinniom.\"  Hinnom is a \\ndeep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem.\\n\\n    In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including \\ninfant sacrifice (It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made \\ntheir children \"pass through the fire\" to the god Molech.  The rites were \\nspecifically celebrated in Tophet, the \"place of abhorrence,\" one of the chief \\ngroves in the valley).\\n\\n    King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations.  He \\ndefiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10).

To the righteous, God says that the wicked shall be \"ashes under the \\nsoles of your feet...\"(Mal.4:3).\\n\\n    Gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living \\ntorture!

Gotta use that\\npressure-treated anywhere that wood meets concrete, but it\\nholds up better anyway for mose outdoor applications.  I keep\\nseeing these bumper-stickers that say \"My boss is a Jewish\\nCarpenter,\" but they\\'re always on the back of Ford Escorts,\\nand a real carpenter\\'s apprentice would probably drive a\\npickup, so I\\'m out for verification that he really was a\\ncarpenter.\\n\\nDean Kaflowitz', \": I heard about the arms sale to Saudi Arabia.  Now, how is it such a grave\\n: mistake to sell Saudi Arabia weapons?  Or are you claiming that we shouldn't\\n: sell any weapons to other countries?  Straightforward answer please.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia is an oppressive regime that has been recently interfering\\nin the politcs of newly renunified Yemen, including assasinations and \\nborder incursions. It is entirely possible that they will soon invade.\\nUnluckily for Yemen it is not popular in the West as they managed to put\\naside political differences during reunification and thus the West has\\neffectively lost one half (North?) as a client state.\", '\\nHmm.  The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn, clearly marked as\\nofficers and yelling \"Police\" repeatedly.  This is used every day to bust drug\\nhouses.  The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and\\ndisplay of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight.  As for not knocking, it\\'s\\na sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even\\nfight.  Usually this strategy works; if it didn\\'t, then it wouldn\\'t be used so\\ncommonly, now would it?\\n\\nWhether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not my\\npoint, since I don\\'t think any of us have enough information to make a clear\\njudgement on this issue.\\n\\nI merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day.\\nFurthermore, we don\\'t know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending\\npotentially dangerous and armed suspects.  Do you suggest that the police\\nalways knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have\\nbeen allowed to inspect the officers\\'s badges?  Just what should the police do\\nwhen apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects?  How far can they\\nreasonably go to identiy themselves?  What do you suggest they can do which\\ncan\\'t be faked by the \"competition\"?\\n\\nEven if you\\'ve got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that\\'s not an\\nexcuse to murder police.  In the case of the BD\\'s, there was almost definitely\\nat most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who would pretend to be cops.', '#|> #\\n#|> #False dichotomy.

Otherwise, I\\'d have to wonder how come mainland\\ncatholics are not killed by mainland protestants, and southern\\ncatholics are not killed by southern protestants, and so on.

Let\\'s consider some \"personal interpretations\"\\nand see how much trust we should put in \"Orthodox Mormonism\", which\\ncould never be confused with Orthodox Christianity.\\n\\n        In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R.\\nMcConkie said they \"thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify\\nElohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised\\nMessiah.\" He also said Christians are wrong to believe \"that Jehovah is\\nthe Supreme Deity [God the Father],\" and that Christ \"came into\\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons\\nbelieve today to be the truth about the matter. He said that \"Elohim is\\nthe Father\" and \"Jehovah is the Son.\"\\n\\n  \"Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists\\n  have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise\\n  to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to\\n  identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the\\n  promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the\\n  Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As\\n  with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the\\n  Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy\\n  Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was\\n  born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.\\n  (Promised Messiah, p. 100)\\n\\n        Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about\\ntheir \"three-in-one God\" and their belief that \"God is a Spirit\" as they\\nare in their understanding of who \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" are. Before\\nexamining McConkie\\'s attack and its validity, we shall read a few more\\nstatements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words\\n\"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah.\" McConkie stated:\\n\\n  \"...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in\\n  the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the\\n  exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)\\n\\n  \"_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\\n  name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\\n  supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon\\n  Doctrine, p. 224)\\n\\n        Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:\\n\\n  \"_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus\\n  Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn\\n  Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,\\n  Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\\n\\n        \"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve\"\\napostles of the Mormon Church states that \"God the Eternal Father...[is]\\ndesignate[d] by the exalted name-title \\'Elohim\\'...\" (Articles of Faith,\\np. 466) \"...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied\\nstate...was known as Jehovah...\" (Articles of Faith, p. 471)\\n\\n        Today Mormon leaders teach that \"Elohim\" in the OT refers to God\\nthe Father and \"Jehovah\" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians\\nfor saying \"Jehovah\" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two\\n\"name-titles\" should not be changed around so that Christ is called\\n\"Elohim\" and the Father is called \"Jehovah.\" \"...the Father...is Elohim,\\nnot Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one\\nand the same person.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 111)\\n\\n        In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word \"Elohim\" is\\nused to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges\\nof Israel. When referring to the true God, \"Elohim\" is translated with a\\ncapital \"G.\" When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges\\nof Israel, it is translated with a small \"g.\" It is translated four\\ntimes as \"judges\" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as \"judge\" (1 Sam. 2:25),\\ntwice as \"mighty\" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as \"angels\" (Ps. 8:5),\\nonce as \"godly\" (Mal. 2:15), once as \"great\" (Gen. 30:8), and once as\\n\"very great.\" (1 Sam. 14:15)\\n\\n        The word \"Jehovah\" is the traditional pronunciation of the\\ntetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word\\n\"Adonai.\"  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the\\ntetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since \"Jehovah\" rather\\nthan Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use\\n\"Jehovah\" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of\\nMormon leaders regarding that name. \"Jehovah,\" unlike \"Elohim,\" is never\\nused of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the\\nBible. In the KJV, \"Jehovah\" is rendered primarily \"LORD,\" sometimes\\n\"GOD,\" and rarely \"Lord.\"\\n\\n        Now that we understand something about the words \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle\\nMcConkie\\'s attack on Christians for believing the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\\nIn trying to prove that \"Jehovah\" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie\\ncited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie\\'s\\ninterpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.\\nRemember, McConkie said the Father is not \"Jehovah;\" He is only\\n\"Elohim.\" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie\\'s\\ninterpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:\\n\\n  \"Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit\\n  and he testified, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right\\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1.) Two\\n  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater\\n  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of\\n  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this\\n  Messianic prophecy?\\n  \"What think ye of Christ?\" our Lord asked certain of his detractors\\n  toward the end of his mortal ministry. \"Whose son is he?\" Is Christ\\n  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent\\n  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he\\n  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the\\n  Jews. And so they answered, \"The Son of David.\"\\n  David\\'s son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our\\n  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,\\n  asked, \"How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord\\n  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine\\n  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his\\n  son?\" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the\\n  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him\\n  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake\\n  unto David\\'s Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is\\n  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: \\'_The\\n  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my\\n  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up\\n  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to\\n  sit on my right hand forever.\\' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)\\n  (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following\\nremark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6\\nreads: \"The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the\\nSon]...\" (brackets in original)\\n\\n        McConkie clearly stated that it is \"Elohim\" the Father who is\\nspeaking to \"Jehovah\" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at\\nthe Hebrew word translated \"LORD,\" it becomes apparent that either the\\nfirst \"LORD\" is not the Father or else the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Either\\nway McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:\\n\\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right\\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)\\n\\n        The first \"LORD\" in this verse is \"Jehovah\" who Mormonism says\\nis Christ, not the Father. The second \"Lord\" is the Hebrew word \"Adon\"\\n(singular for \"Adonai,\" meaning master or lord). If the first \"LORD\" is\\nthe Father and the second \"Lord\" is the Son, then the Father is\\n\"Jehovah\" and the Son is \"Adon.\" However, if the Father is not \"Jehovah\"\\nas McConkie claimed, then the first \"LORD\" is \"Jehovah\" the Son, but\\nwho, then, is \"Adon?\" Obviously the Father is \"Jehovah\" in this Psalm,\\nand His Son is \"Adon.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated\\nthe following:\\n\\n  \"I the Lord have called thee in righteousness,\" _Isaiah quoted the\\n  Father as saying of Christ_, \"and will hold thine hand, and will keep\\n  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the\\n  Gentiles.\" (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage\\nwhich reads:\\n\\n  \"I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold\\n  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the\\n  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)\\n\\n        According to McConkie, \"I the LORD\" refers to the Father, and\\n\"thine\" and \"thee\" refer to Christ. However, the \"LORD\" who is speaking\\nis \"Jehovah\" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking\\nor else the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie\\nstated:\\n\\n  shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord\\n  that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in\\n  him.\" (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is\\n  found in these words: \"The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes\\n  and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be\\n  the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will\\n  believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will\\n  have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which\\n  were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.\" (Matt.\\n  27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:\\n\\n  \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they\\n  shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would\\n  deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.\\n\\n        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment \"as Jesus hung\\non the cross.\" That means the person who was scorned in these verses was\\nChrist. Who, then, was the \"LORD\" in whom he trusted? It was \"Jehovah\"\\nthe Father.\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,\\nMcConkie stated the following:\\n\\n  \"With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our\\n  Lord\\'s arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: \"They took counsel\\n  together against me, they devised to take away my life.\" (Ps. 31:13.)\\n  \"Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\" (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised\\n  Messiah, p. 532)\\n\\n        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ\\'s \"arrest and\\njudicial trials.\" We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While\\nMcConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included\\nto give a complete understanding of the matter.\\n\\n  \"For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while\\n  they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my\\n  life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God\\n  [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)\\n\\n        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes\\non to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the \"LORD\" who is called His\\n\"God\" or \"Elohim.\" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is\\n\"Elohim\" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the \"Elohim\" of the\\nman Jesus is \"Jehovah\" the Father.\\n\\n        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses\\nwill be considered in this examination.\\n\\n  \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\\n  But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that\\n  I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)\\n\\n        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas\\' role in\\nChrist\\'s death. Since it was Judas who was the \"familiar friend\" who\\n\"lifted up his heel,\" the pronouns \"mine,\" \"I,\" \"my,\" and \"me\" in verse\\n9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there\\nis a change of pronoun to \"thou,\" which refers to the \"LORD\" (Jehovah).\\nThen the pronouns \"me\" and \"I\" which refer to Christ are used again.\\nThat means Christ was speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Father in these verses.\\n\\n        Another example involves McConkie\\'s following remark about Ps.\\n        110:4.\\n\\n  \"One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,\\n  ever after the order of Melchizedek.\" (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,\\n  p. 450)\\n\\n        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ.\\nThe question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?\\n\\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest\\n  for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)\\n\\n        Does the \"LORD,\" which is \"Jehovah,\" refer to Christ? If\\nMcConkie is right and Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but the Father is not, then\\nthe \"LORD\" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one\\naddressed as the \"priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?\" The\\nBible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10;\\n6:20; 7); therefore, the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.\\n\\n        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie\\nstated:\\n\\n  \"Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...\\n     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....\\n     It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)\\n     (emphasis added)\\n\\n        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to \"the atoning\\nsacrifice of the future Messiah.\" However, what he failed to mention is\\nthat they also prove that the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Verse 6 reads: \"All\\nwe like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;\\nand the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us\\nall,\" and verse 10 reads: \"Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise\\nhim [Christ]...\"\\n\\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" who laid on Christ \"the iniquity of us all\"\\nand who bruised Him is God the Father who is called \"Jehovah\" in these\\nverses.\\n\\n        Remember, McConkie stated that \"some sectarians even believe\\nthat Jehovah is the Supreme Deity,\" and that Christ \"came into\\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. He called this concept\\n\"misinformation\" that is \"untrue.\" To prove that it is McConkie who is\\nmisinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.\\n7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding\\nthese Scriptures:\\n\\n  \"In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of\\n  the Seed of David: \"I will be his father, and he shall be my son.\" (2\\n  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly\\n  Messianic, occurs this statement: \"Thou art my Son; this day have I\\n  begotten thee.\" (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in\\n  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the\\n  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)\\n\\n        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7\\nrefer to Christ who \"would come as the Son of God.\" Since McConkie first\\nreferenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with\\nverse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.\\n\\n  \"And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people\\n  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the\\n  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.\\n  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,\\n  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy\\n  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\\n  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of\\n  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2\\n  Sam. 7:11-14)\\n\\n        These verses teach that the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) would have a Son,\\nthe Messiah.\\n        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination\\nwill include verse 8. Notice that it is the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) who says,\\n\"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\"\\n\\n  \"I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou\\n  art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\\n  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,\\n  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\\n\\n        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are \"clearly Messianic,\"\\nand he acknowledged they teach that \"Christ would come as the Son of\\nGod.\" What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these\\nScriptures also teach that the Father is \"Jehovah\" and that the\\n\"sectarians\" who believe \"Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son\" is\\nJesus Christ, \"the Only Begotten,\" are right in their belief.\\n\\n        Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated\\nthe following:\\n\\n  \"And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,\\n  this is he of whom it is written_: \"He shall stand and feed in the\\n  strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his\\n  God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\" (Mic.\\n  5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        According to McConkie, the pronoun \"He\" at the beginning of Mic.\\n5:4 refers to Christ \"during his mortal ministry.\" Who, then, is the\\n\"LORD his God?\" Mic. 5:4 reads:\\n\\n  \"And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD\\n  [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God\\n  [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\\n\\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" of Jesus Christ is \"Jehovah\" the Father who\\nis referred to as \"Jehovah his Elohim.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses\\nMcConkie stated the following:\\n\\n  \"A number of Messianic passages speak of \"the Lord, and...his\\n  anointed\" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated\\n  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus\\n  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah\\'s prophecy. \"The\\n  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek\" (Isa.\\n  61:1), and then saying: \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your\\n  ears\" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:\\n\\n  \"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel\\n  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.\\n\\n        McConkie said the \"anointed\" one was Christ. If that is true,\\nwho was \"Jehovah?\" If \"Jehovah\" is always Christ, who was the \"anointed\"\\none? Obviously \"Jehovah\" is referring to God the Father and the\\n\"anointed\" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie\\ncited is Isa. 61:1 which states:\\n\\n  \"The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the\\n  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;\\n  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to\\n  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;\\n\\n        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open\\nwas Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse\\nsays the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same\\nproblem. If \"Jehovah\" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,\\nthen Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, \"Jesus\\napplied these passages to himself.\" Therefore, the \"Jehovah\" who\\nanointed Christ is God the Father.\\n\\n        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other\\nMormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not \"Jehovah.\"\\nHowever, these should be enough to expose their error.\\n\\n        Now, what about Mormonism\\'s claim that Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but\\nHe is not \"Elohim?\" It is true that Jesus is \"Jehovah.\" The following\\nScriptures prove this fact:\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer\\n  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and\\n  beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6)\\n  [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and\\n  was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18)\\n\\n  \"...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have\\n  pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only\\n  son... (Zech. 12:1,10)\\n  Behold, he [Christ] cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,\\n  and they also which pierced him... (Rev. 1:7)\\n\\n  \"...I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel... (Isa.\\n  43:3)\\n  ...Ye denied the Holy One [Christ] and the Just... (Acts 3:14)\\n\\n  \"And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of\\n  the LORD [Jehovah] shall be delivered... (Joel 2:32)\\n  \"...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name\\n  under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

(Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not\\nthe \"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" of the Mormons.\\n\\n        Another Mormon error regarding \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" is the\\nbelief that \"Elohim,\" not \"Jehovah,\" is the Father of all the spirits,\\nincluding Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage,\\n\"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve\" apostles\\nstates that \"God the Eternal Father...\\'Elohim,\\' is the literal Parent\\nof...the spirits of the human race.\" (p. 466) This \"Doctrinal\\nExposition\" also states explicitly that \"Jesus Christ is not the Father\\nof the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth,\\nfor He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of\\nElohim.\" (p. 473)\\n\\n        The Apostle Talmage stated that \"_Elohim_...is the name-title of\\nGod the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is\\n_Jehovah_--\" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\\n\\n        The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this\\nmatter: \"...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms\\nof plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to\\nplacing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the\\nFather himself became personally involved. All things were created by\\nthe Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the\\nspirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was\\nno delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was\\nconcerned.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Mormon leaders claim that \"Jehovah-Christ\" did not create either\\nman\\'s spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon \"Elohim,\" who is\\nthe father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the\\ntruth about who created man.\\n\\n  \"And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,\\n  Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all\\n  flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also\\n  16:20-23) (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth\\n  the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within\\n  him_.

(Jer. 38:16)\\n\\n  \"For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for\\n  the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which I have\\n  made_....\\n  ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]... (Isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis on \"souls...I\\n  have made\" added)\\n\\n  \"Behold, I am the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] _of all flesh_...\\n  (Jer. 32:27) (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that _formed thee\\n  from the womb_.\\n  I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things...

(Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added)\\n\\n        The Bible reveals that it is \"Jehovah\" who is the \"Elohim of the\\nspirits of all flesh\" and \"of all flesh\" itself, that it was He who\\n\"formed the spirit of man within him,\" that He \"made us this soul\" and\\n\"formed us from the womb.\" He did indeed \"create man.\"\\n\\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is \"Jehovah,\"\\nthen they are wrong when they say he did not create man. If they are\\nright when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are\\nwrong when they say he is not \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n        Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man,\\nMormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:\\n\\n  \"Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....\\n  And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for\\n  never has man believed in me as thou hast....\\n  Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and\\n  _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16)\\n  (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _I\\n  that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of\\n  Jacob...is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and\\n  all things that in them are.\\n  Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        D&C, 93:10 states that \"the worlds were made by him [Christ];\\n_men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him,\\nand of him.\" (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving \"Jehovah\" and his\\ncreation is the belief that \"Jehovah\" had \"many\" pre-mortal spirits\\nhelping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.\\n\\n  \"That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by \"many of\\n  the noble and great\" spirit children of the Father is evident from\\n  go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these\\n  materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.\" (Abra.\\n  3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,\\n  Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other \"noble and\\n  great\" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines\\n  of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)\\n\\n        The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee\\n  from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that\\n  stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by\\n  myself. (Isa. 44:24)\\n\\n  \"Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of\\n  the sea. (Job 9:8)\\n\\n        \"Jehovah,\" by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged\\npreexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.\\n\\n        Regarding the Mormon \\'Elohim,\" the Apostle McConkie stated:\\n\"Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\\nname-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\\nsupremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods.\" (Mormon\\nDoctrine, p. 224) He also stated that \"Jesus...is above all save the\\nFather only.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 363)\\n\\n        The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called\\ngods is the triune God \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above\\n  all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)\\n\\n  \"For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art\\n  exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)\\n\\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)\\n\\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say \"Jehovah\" is god the\\nson and \"Elohim\" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be\\nteaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie\\nclearly stated, Mormons believe \"Elohim\" the father, not \"Jehovah\" the\\nson, is the \"God above all Gods\" -- that Jesus is above all except the\\nfather; yet the Bible teaches that \"Jehovah\" is above all \"Elohim.\"\\n\\n        At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the\\nfollowing remark about praying to Jesus:\\n\\n  \"Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly\\n  to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been\\n  developed....\\n  This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the\\n  Father, and to him only....\\n  ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;\\n  it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With\\n  the Lord, pp. 19-20)\\n\\n        McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the\\nMormons \"pray to the Father, not the Son...\" On p. 306 of the same book\\nMcConkie states that \"Christ [the Son] is Jehovah.\" This is important to\\nremember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to\\nthe Mormon Christ who is \"Jehovah,\" the Bible states repeatedly in the\\nOT that people prayed to \"Jehovah,\" and He not only heard those prayers,\\nbut He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small\\nsample of the vast number of times people prayed to \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n  \"In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my\\n  God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came\\n  before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)\\n\\n  \"And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy\\n  supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this\\n  house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine\\n  eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)\\n\\n  \"And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our\\n  supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD\\n  [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)\\n\\n  \"O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to\\n  the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who\\n  desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)\\n\\n  \"And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this\\n  prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before\\n  the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his\\n  hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)\\n\\n  \"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed\\n  unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)\\n\\n  \"Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God\\n  [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy\\n  tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)\\n\\n  \"I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid.

(Ps. 32:5-6)\\n\\n        Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the \"godly\" pray to \"Jehovah.\"\\nAccording to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very\\none to whom McConkie said people should not pray.\\n\\n        The Bible reveals there is only one true \"Elohim,\" and His name\\nis \"Jehovah.\" All other \"Elohim\" are false. They are idols that cause\\ntheir followers to commit adultery against the true \"Elohim\" and\\nidolatry.\\n\\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to\\n  be feared above all gods [Elohim].\\n  For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD\\n  [Jehovah] made the heavens.

(Jud. 2:12)\\n\\n  \"Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods\\n  [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I\\n  will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know\\n  that my name is the LORD [Jehovah].

(Josh.\\n  24:15-16)\\n\\n        These verses teach that the only true, living \"Elohim\" in heaven\\nand on earth is \"Jehovah\" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth\\nand all therein.\\n\\n        \"Jehovah\" is greater than any \"Elohim,\" because all other\\n\"Elohim\" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17)\\n\"Jehovah Elohim\" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding\\nthese false \"Elohim.\" He told His people not to have any \"Elohim\" but\\nHim. He told the people that if they left Him for the false \"Elohim,\"\\nthose \"Elohim\" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and\\nwould perish. He warned the people to \"take heed\" that their \"heart be\\nnot deceived\" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making\\ncovenants with false \"Elohim.\" \"Jehovah Elohim\" told His people He would\\neventually judge all false \"Elohim\" and their followers.\\n\\n        Despite these warnings and guidelines, \"Elohim\\'s\" covenant\\npeople forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false \"Elohim\\'s\" of\\nthe people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that \"the children\\nof Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served\\nBaalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods\\n[Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim]\\nof the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and\\nforsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him.\"\\n\\n        This examination has shown that the \"Elohim\" of Mormonism, like\\nthe \"Elohim\" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true \"Jehovah Elohim.\" Therefore,\\nthe people who leave the true \"Elohim\" for the Mormon \"Elohim\" will do\\n\"evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah].\"\\n\\n        Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a\\ntriune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father\\n[Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is\\ntriune; He is Spirit; He is \"Jehovah;\" and He did send His Son into the\\nworld to redeem mankind.\\n\\n        It is obvious from this examination that it is not the\\nChristians who \"thrash around in...darkness\" about who \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" are. One wonders what \"Holy Writ\" McConkie had in mind when he\\nstated that it attests to the fact that \"Elohim is the Father, and that\\nJehovah is the Son.\" He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches\\nthat the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one \"Jehovah Elohim.\"\\nHe apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses\\n1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as\\n\"Jehovah.\"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n        Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith\\'s statement that the Mormons\\n\"have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God\" (Doctrines\\nof Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true\\nGod as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to\\ncommit adultery against God and idolatry.\\n\\n        In answer to Jesus\\' question, \"But whom say ye that I am,\"\\nMormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in\\nthe Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in\\nthe Mormon Jesus is believing in \"another Jesus\" whom Paul warned about.\\n\\n        Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy,\\nadmitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that\\nthe Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus.

They do not have the Son; therefore,\\nthey do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the\\nApostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: \"Salvation comes only by\\nworshiping the true God.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also\\nrightly stated that \"the mere worship of a god who has the proper\\nscriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and\\nliving God,\" because the \"true names of Deity\" can be applied to \"false\\nconcepts of God.\" (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle\\nStephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave \"a new\\nconception of God and the Godhead.\" (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p.\\n1)\\n\\n        It is important for the people who have left the true triune God\\nrevealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the\\nsins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.\\n\\n  \"...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from\\n  me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD\\n  [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)\\n\\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\\n\\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)\\n\\n  \"...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be\\n  clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)\\n\\n  \"...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)\\n\\n        It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible.\\nIf they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and\\nidolatry.

Women\\'s right to own property is revoked,\\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.

In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".

It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.

I took me a long time to come\\nto the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a\\n\"rosicrucian\" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met\\nsome \\'rosicrucians\\' you mean \"members of a group that calls themselves\\nrosicrucian\". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)\\n\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis makes much sense to me.  This is also true of most religions.\\nThere is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people\\nwho call themselves \\'Hindus\\' or \\'Christians\\' or \\'Pagans\\' and actually\\n*BEING* any of these.  The social groups tend to make very important\\nrequirements about not belonging to other \\'religions\\'.  I find that\\nthe ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be\\ninterpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that\\n\\'mysticism\\' is the core of every religion and Huxley\\'s \\'Perennial\\nPhilosophy\\' is the Great Secret Core of all mystical trads. :>\\n\\n\\nTony:\\n\\nI\\'d prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium\\nRosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this\\nnewsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in\\nSan Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I\\nlooked). Of course, \"most members\" does not *necessarily* mean \"best\".\\n\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nCertainly true.  I didn\\'t know there WERE any groups which called themselves\\n\\'Rosicrucians\\' that didn\\'t associate with AMORC.  Sure, I\\'ve heard all the\\nhubbub about the Golden Dawn and Rosae Crucis in relation to all these\\nWestern esoteric groups, but hadn\\'t heard about other \\'Rosicrucians\\'.\\nI\\'ll admit my bias.  I live in San Jose. :>\\n\\n\\nTony:\\n\\n\"You\\'ll have to trust me\" when I tell you that if that\\nlecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you\\nwould have had the same impression, i.e., you\\'d probably have had a\\npositive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. \\n\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis may be slightly off.  I\\'ve met some of these Rosicrucians and have\\na couple friends in AMORC.  The stories I\\'ve heard and the slight contact\\nI\\'ve had with them does not give me the hope that I\\'d be received with\\nany kind of warm welcome.

Thanks.\\n', '-*----\\n\\n\\nNo.  It follows from the fact that most Christians\\' choice of\\ninterpretation stems from a mix of beliefs that are influenced by\\nthe secular ethics of their culture and that are not fully\\ndetermined by scripture.  Whether or not there is some \"right\"\\ninterpretation matters not; few Christians claim the ability to\\nread the mind of their god.  Dave Davis should note that it was\\nMichael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural\\ninfluence in this thread.  I think Michael is right in this, but\\nregardless, it should be noted that this has *not* been a point\\nof contention between Michael and myself. \\n\\nI have argued -- beyond Michael\\'s claims -- that the Christian\\nscriptures are open to so many interpretations -- including a\\nwide divergence within the Christian tradition -- that even their\\nmost important themes are vague.  Again, it does not matter that\\nthere is some \"right\" interpretation *unless* there is a way to\\ndetermine what that \"right\" interpretation is.  It is the lack of\\nan objective measure, not the presumed lack of an answer, that\\nputs the force behind the line I argue.\\n\\n\\nThere are enough Christian glasses, varying over a sufficiently\\nbroad range of color, that I can find a few that support my\\nexample. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn my opinion, what makes Michael radical is that he fully\\nacknowledges that Christian scripture and tradition fail to\\ndetermine the doctrines that so many branches within Christianity\\nhold dear.  He is willing to live and practice his religion\\nwithin this indeterminacy, and he is willing to acknowledge that\\nmuch of his understanding of things Christian is influenced by\\nideas that are not purely Christian.  Those Christians I have\\ncalled conservative must also interpret, but they do not\\nrecognize -- or at least, are unwilling to admit -- the extent and\\nimportance of this.\\n\\n\\nI recognize that Michael is part of the tradition.  But what does\\nit tell one about a tradition covering Origen, Aquinas, Jerry\\nFallwell, and Jesse Jackson that it also includes Michael Siemon?\\nNot very much!\\n\\n\\n\\nI think the conclusion does follow.  The purely Christian\\nprinciples that Michael has are the ones he shares with others in\\nthe Christian tradition or that can be derived from Christian\\nscripture.  These, necessarily vague, are not enough to drive his\\npolitical stances.  That one should love one\\'s neighbor is a \\npurely Christian principle.  That this means showing tolerance \\nfor homosexuality is *not*.\\n\\nAs to these political stances, they are often at odds with what\\nis commonly held in most of current Christendom, and so I \\nsuspect they could be better pressed outside it.  (On the other\\nhand, I can well understand the counterpoint, that these \\npolitical stances become most influential when presented to \\nthose who need them most.)\\n\\n-*----\\n\\nHaving barely survived the effort to finish in computer science, I\\ndoubt I will attempt a more difficult field any time soon!', \"\\nAs I understand, that number is deceptive.

Smith.  The introduction is written by\\nPaul Kurtz. \\n\\n\\tMormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\n\\t-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one of\\n\\tthe world\\'s fastest growing religions, with as many as\\n\\t200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the church\\'s\\n\\taggressive missionary program, covering more than one\\n\\thundred countries, it is spreading even to third world\\n\\tcountries.\\n\\t\\n\\tMormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and\\n\\tevangelical in preachment.  The church is run along strict\\n\\tauthoritarian lines.  Led by a president, who allegedly\\n\\treceives revelations directly form God, and a group of\\n\\ttwelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief\\n\\tand practice, the church is opposed to abortion,\\n\\tpornography, sexual freedom, women\\'s rights, and other, in\\n\\tits view, immoral influences of secular society, and it\\n\\tforbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea.\\n\\t\\n\\tCentered in Salt Lake City, the church is extremely wealthy\\n\\tand politically powerful in Utal and many other western\\n\\tstates.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft\\n\\tBenson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family,\\n\\tthe Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed\\n\\tgovernment officials.\\n\\t\\n\\tThe Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by\\n\\tJoseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had\\n\\tfound gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill\\n\\tand that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he\\n\\thad been able to translate the writing into the _Book of\\n\\tMormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written \"by\\n\\tthe commandment of God,\" claims that the ancient Hebrews\\n\\tsettled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors\\n\\tof the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who\\n\\thave been baptized in the \"true church\" will be reunited\\n\\tafter death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can\\n\\tbe baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the\\n\\thereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been\\n\\tconsidered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and\\n\\tas heretics by religious fundamentalists.\\n\\t\\n\\tJoseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was\\n\\tboth worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because\\n\\tof persecution he led his band of loyal followers from\\n\\tPalmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois,\\n\\twhere in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham\\n\\tYoung, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over\\n\\tthe leadership of the church and led the Mormons further\\n\\twestward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City. \\n\\tFollowing the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of\\n\\tpolygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice\\n\\tin nineteenth-century America.\\n\\t\\n\\tWhile other religions go back many centuries --\\n\\tMuhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism,\\n\\t3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are\\n\\tdifficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon\\n\\troots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this\\n\\thistory objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny\\n\\tis dangerous to the faith.\\n\\t\\n\\tIn the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles\\n\\tabout the Mormon church.  First, George D. Smith, a lifelong\\n\\tmember of the church, provides a detailed critical\\n\\texamination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of\\n\\tMormon_ was divinely revealed.

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\\n\\n\\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \\nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \\nTribulation.  \"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \\nsaved.\" - Matthew 24:13\\n\\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\\n\\n\\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\\nthe rapture until Christ\\'s second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob\\'s\\n(Israel\\'s) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel\\'s Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \\nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\\n\\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\\n\\n\\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \\n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \\npossession during the Tribulation.\\n\\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\\n\\n\\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \\nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\\nunfold before you.  \\n\\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\\n\\n\\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \\nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \\nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\\nsake of Christ.  \\n\\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\\n\\n\\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \\nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \\nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \\n\\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \\nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist\\'s\\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \\nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \\nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\\n\\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \\nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \\nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \\ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\\nthe mark.  \\n\\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \\nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \\nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \\npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \\n14:9-10 \\n\\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \\n\\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\\n\\n\\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist\\'s government\\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \\nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\\n\\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist\\'s control will come last to the least\\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \\nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\\nclosings\" --M] \\nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \\nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\\n\\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\\n\\t\\n\\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist\\'s\\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\\n\\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\\n\\n\\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \\n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \\nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \\npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \\npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\\n\\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \\nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\\n\\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\\n\\n\\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \\nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \\n\\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \\nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\\n\\n\\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\\n\\n******************************************************************************\\nMike Cluff\\t\\t\\t\\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\\t*  \\n******************************************************************************\\n\\n\\n/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\ \\n\\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \\n\\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.', \"\\t[...details of US built chemical plant at Al Alteer near Baghdad...]\\n: However, the plant's intended use was to aid the Iraqi infrastructure.\\n: It is not an example of selling a weapon.

The same cycle of emotional\\nresponses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only\\na couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works,\\nthank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit\\nthat I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion.\\n\\n\\nI used to believe what I read in books when I was younger, or what\\nother people told me, but I grew more and more skeptical the more I\\nread.

I _hated_ experiments\\nlike this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workload\\nconsiderably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first\\nattempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson: \\n\\nNo matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X,\\nit may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take\\na leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. \\nBut it can still be wrong. \\n\\nI found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism\\nto believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, \\nfiltering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god\\nplaying any part. \\n\\n\\nOh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better\\ndocumented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented\\nquite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too\\nmuch attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of\\nthe gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,\\nthe end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.\\n\\nJesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.\\n\\n\\nThis is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind,\\nand that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I\\nobserve. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the\\nevidence. \\n\\nIt makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not.\\nI assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.\\n\\n\\nA liar, how do you know what my attitude was?

As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you,\\nme, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9)\\nin the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression,\\nan earthly probationary time was required.  (To live by faith, not by\\nsight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things\\nto become worthy of a higher order of existance.)  We believe that all of\\nGod\\'s spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of\\nthis earthly sojourn.  One-third chose for Lucifer\\'s plan, most followed\\nthe Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ).  Lucifer\\'s aspirations (\"I\\nwill exalt my throne above the stars of God . . .\" Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.)\\nresulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and\\nthose who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who\\nbecame Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven\\n(\"And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast\\nthem to the earth . . .\" Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).\\n\\nTo get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to\\nGod and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices),\\nwe made that choice individually.  (God speaking to Job: \"Where wast thou\\nwhen I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars\\nsang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\" Job 38:4-7).  We\\nlost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the \"Veil of Forgetful-\\nness,\" somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight.\\n\\nYou may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the\\nBible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular\\naspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God.\\n\\n#Who is god to impose its rules on us ?

Mark and Luke speak of darkness and\\nthe veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints. \\nJohn is the only one who mentions Jesus\\'s side being peirced.\\n\\n\\nMatthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being\\nstolen by the disciples, and for the tomb to be sealed. All of this was\\nsupposedly done, but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.\\n\\nDepends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will\\nspend \"three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\", and Mark 10:34\\nhas \"after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again\". As far as I can\\nsee from a quick look, the prophecies have \"after three days\", but the\\npost-resurrection narratives have \"on the third day\".\\n\\n\\nMatthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says it\\nwas dark.\\n\\n\\nMAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the first\\nday of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.\\n\\nMAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother \\nof  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and\\nanoint him.\\n\\nJOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it \\nwas  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the\\nsepulchre.\\n\\n\\nMAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the\\nLord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door,\\nand sat upon it.\\nMAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white as\\nsnow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became as\\ndead men.

The disciples then went\\nto a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only\\nappearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses\\nto the visit with the disciples.\\n\\nMark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that\\nthey told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he\\nappeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.\\n\\nLuke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to\\nEmmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but\\nwas unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally\\nrecognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem,\\nthey told the\\ndisciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them,\\nfrightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish\\nand honey and then preached to them.\\n\\nJohn says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in\\nJeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but\\nThomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined\\nthe disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.\\tOnce\\nmore Jesus made an\\nappearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not\\nrecognised.\\n After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus\\nbecomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat\\ntogether and converse.\\n\\nThe book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed\\nhimself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus\\ncontradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things\\npertaining to the kingdom of God: \"And when he had spoken these things, while\\nthey beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. \\nAnd while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood\\nby them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye\\ngazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven,\\nshall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven\" Acts 1:3-11\\n\\nPaul outdoes every other \"authority\" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500\\npersons between the time of the resurection and the\\nassension, although he does not say where.\\tHe also claims that he himself \"as\\none born out of due time\" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.\\n\\n\\nMatthew says nothing about it.\\tMark casually says that Jesus was recieved into\\nheaven after he was finished talking with the\\ndisciples in Jeruselem.

Someones even made the statement that science is\\n\"subjective\" and that even atom are \"subjective.\" This is getting a bit silly\\nand the word \"objective\" is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering the\\ndefinition of \"objective\" which has been already presented:\\n\\n  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as \\n    distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.\\n    3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on\\n    observable phenomenon.\\n\\nThe Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that\\nthing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there\\nexist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable\\nphenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental\\nprocesses, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable\\nphenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. \\nEven weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though\\nthat observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenon\\naffected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not\\nchange to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is not\\nobjective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the\\npoint of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively \"good;\" I\\nwill not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. \\n\\nNow some examples things which are \"objective\":  A D-12 tractor is larger\\nthan the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt.\\nThere exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks \\nultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.\\n\\n\"Good\" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn\\'t seem to have an\\nexistence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the\\nexistence of an omnipotent entity which has defined \"good\").  We cannot\\nquantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag\\nfull of \"good\").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word \"good\" an\\nobjective meaning, e.g.  \"good\" has been used to denote strength, resiliency,\\nspeed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see\\n\"strength\" and etc, as necessarily \"good\" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism \\nis not generally viewed as \"good\"). \\n\\nAs to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based\\non verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form of\\nthe \"Golden Rule,\" which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss\\npeople off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a\\nmanner you won\\'t like.  This is verifiable; when you \"get in someone\\'s face,\"\\nthey will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that a\\nmore powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can\\nat times, ignore that form of the \"Golden Rule\" without fear of reprisal.  Now\\nas to whether this enforcing of morality is \"good\" or \"bad,\" is quite\\nsubjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing\\ncannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that\\nthat it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical\\nexistence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such\\nthing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a\\nmorality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such\\nmorality. \\n\\nOne other thing to notice, \"objective\" is many times used as synonymous with\\n\"true\" and/or \"absolute,\" and \"subjective\" sometimes has the connotation of\\n\"false\" and/or \"relative.\" Tain\\'t necessarily so.  For instance, when a\\nconclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be\\nboth objective and false.  As to \"absolute,\" it is easy to note that while we\\ncan objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean\\nthat all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute\\neither.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either\\n\"absolutist,\" or \"true.\" For instance, there are some theists who are\\nspecifically \"absolutist\" in their morality, even though they have only\\nsubjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detective\\nhas been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a \"gut feeling\" or \"hunch\"), to\\ninvestigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence\\nnecessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have to\\nagree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective\\nevidence.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler', '[ deleted ]\\n[ deleted ]\\n\\n  Your information on this topic is very much out of date.

Jesus doesn\\'t view\\nguilt like our modern venacular colors it.   \\n\\n\"Feelings\" have nothing to do with guilt.  Feelings arise from the state of \\nbeing guilty.  Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive.  Feelings are a \\nreaction from guilt.  Jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the \\nreaction.   Let me give you an example:\\n\\nHave you ever made a mistake?  Have you ever lied to someone?  Even a\\nlittle white lie?   Have you ever claimed to know something that you really \\ndidn\\'t know?  Have you ever hated someone?  Have you ever been selfish?\\nAre you guilty of any one of these?   The answer is of course, YES.  You\\nare guilty.  Period.  That is it what Jesus is getting at.  No big surprise.  \\nFeelings do not even enter the picture.   Consider Jesus\\'s use of the word\\n\"guilt\" as how a court uses it.\\n\\nJesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being\\nimperfect.  The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners.  We all do\\nbad things.  Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our \\nguilt that we are all sinners.     It is it in our nature to do bad things. \\nWe are sinners, therefore we do bad things.  Being a sinner is fact.  It is\\nnot a pleasant fact.  But it is just a fact.  We are not perfect.   Calling us\\nsinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a\\nhuman being.  Guilty as charged.\\n\\n\\nYou can handle your guilt in one of two ways:  Acknowledge you\\nmade a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--in\\nthe meantime, not punishing yourself for it:  which is the\\nway Jesus wants you to handle or it.  This is the healthy way.\\n\\nOr two, the destructive way:  put yourself down, slap yourself\\nand feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself to\\nsay a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide.  This the way \\nJesus does NOT want us to deal with it.   All people fall into this \\ncategory to some extent in their lives.\\n\\nJesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt\\nfeeling.  Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he\\nloves us despite our guilt.  Jesus knows we are guilty.  That\\nisn\\'t new to him.  It is no big deal to him. He just wants you to realize \\nthat this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him.\\nThat is what he wants you to know.  Why, because he wants to \\nhave your company.  You are immensely valuable to him.\\nJesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our present\\nsinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship.  \\n\\nGod is perfect.  We are not.  You cannot fit a square peg into\\na round hole.  However, God has provided a way for us to\\nchange our nature so that we can have a relationship with him.\\nGod has provided Jesus, so that whosoever just believes in\\nJesus, will have their nature changed.  The Holy Spirit will\\nmove it.  And now divine nature is now within lives our very\\nbeing--and us and God communicate with each through his\\nunifying Holy Spirit.  The benefits of this are endless.  For\\nwith the divine nature living within us, we can now see\\nour imperfections better.  We can now head them off at the pass.  With\\nthe power of the Holy Spirit living in us, we now have his power\\nto help us overcome our shortcomings.   Because the divine nature lives \\nwithin us, we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before\\nwe could understand.  Because the divine nature now lives within us, we now \\nhave authority over demonic forces.  And lastly, because the divine \\nnature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the Holy Spirit\\nis eternal.\\n\\nThe relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance.  Because\\nit is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to\\nheavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living God.\\nRemember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he\\nseparated the \"goats from the sheep\".   Many people in the\\nlast day will ask him, \"Didn\\'t I prophesy in your name and do\\nmiracles, and do good things in your name?\"   And what did Jesus say?\\n\"Depart from me, for I never *knew* you.\"  That is the cornerstone of \\nChristianity, Kent.  Jesus must know you as his friend.  It is your \\nrelationship to Jesus.  If he is your friend and you are his, you will\\nbe counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven.  \\n\\n\\nGood.  It shows that you have a strong self-image--that you\\nlove yourself.  That is the second greatest commandment Jesus\\ntaught.  If only more people could do as you do.   As I said before, \\nin the common english venacular, \"feeling guilty\" has a\\ndifferent meaning than the state of guilt.\\n\\n\\nI believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego,\\na lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more unconditional love.\\n', \"\\n  Me too.

A marked police car could have driven\\nup to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and\\nserved the warrant usual way.

King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner:\\n\\n * \"The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *\\n *  treated as a matter of faith.\" -- Francis Hitching                     *\\n\\n  I have a few points to make about the above posting.\\n\\n    1. Science is not based on and does not consist of \"quotes\" from either\\n    real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)\\n    experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive\\n    confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike\\n    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to\\n    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests\\n    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they\\n    are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a\\n    creationist and this may not be your real intent.\\n\\n    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his\\n    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the\\n    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.\\n    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context\\n    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate\\n    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may\\n    not be your real intent.\\n\\n    3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of \"the modern theory of\\n    evolution\" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one\\n    line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that\\n    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate\\n    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck\\n    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond\\n    of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not\\n    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.\\n\\n    4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack\\n    on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on\\n    science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the\\n    fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long\\n    ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and\\n    irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a\\n    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.\\n\\n\\nWarren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:\\n\\n * Neither I, nor Webster\\'s has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *\\n\\n  I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster\\'s B^).  Francis Hitchings\\nis a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the\\npart of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution (\"The Neck of\\nthe Giraffe\").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton)\\nusing the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could\\nnot have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution\\n(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a \"non sequitur\" (i.e.\\nthe conclusion \"does not follow\").

And I\\nhave not yet received an answer.\\n\\n\\nNope.  It may well be unknowable.  Scientists have suggested that the\\nuniverse may be finite and wrap around on itself (the three-dimensional\\nuniverse may be mapped onto a four-dimensional supersphere in the same\\nway you can map a two-dimensional plane onto a three-dimensional\\nsphere; see _Sphereland_, the sequel to _Flatland_, for more thoughts\\non this).

This has an easy answer, and\\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\\nthis way by a critical reader.\\n\\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\\nit bit him on the keister twice.\\n\\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\\nauthor\\'s history of whatever.)\\n\\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\\nthe text provide evidence?\\n\\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \\nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\\nthan teach history.\\n\\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\\nsubject.

For one, your claim that everyone senses it\\n#is not founded, and you have been asked to give evidence for it often.\\n#And then, the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it\\n#is there unless evidence against it has been found.\\n\\nI have no problem with the second statement.  I have provided an\\nargument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the\\nonly cogent objection to this came from jon livesey, and was offered\\nby some other people too: essentially, that people disagree about\\nfuzzy concepts such as Freedom.  It\\'s a good point, and I\\'m thinking\\nabout it.\\n# \\n#Your trick is to say, I feel A is not right, and so do many I know,\\n#therefore A is absolutely right. It neglects the possibility that\\n#these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process,\\n#restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject\\n#of that process. In other words, refutes it. You make the ontological\\n#claim, you have to prove it.\\n\\nNonsense.  My \"trick\" is to say:  I feel that A is better than B and so \\ndoes almost any disinterested person I ask.  Best evidence is therefore \\nthat A really is better than B, subject to the assumption that we\\ncan establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B, and\\nthat the resulting system of values is self-consistent.\\n\\nNow get this:  \"really is better\" is an idealisation, a fictional model,\\nin the same sense that \"real material existence\" is a fictional model. It\\nmay or may not correspond to something true.  It is nonetheless a useful\\n_assumption_.  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist \\n\"trick\", to wit:\\n\\nI feel that A is better than B, and so does almost any disinterested person\\nI ask.  However, if even one person disagrees that A is better than B,\\nor if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B,\\nthen it is the case that B is better than A for that person, and nothing\\nmore can be said.  \\n\\nI say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority\\nseeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to\\nmaximise B (e.g. a terrorist).  To do that would be to claim that \\na supermajority\\'s carefully considered morality would be better than the \\nterrorist\\'s - which would, of course, be true, but a no-no for an ethical\\nrelativist.  To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is\\nsimply weasel words, and an example of compartmentalisation to rival\\nanything in the world of religion.\\n\\n#>#For a similar argument, I sense morality is subjective, it does not\\n#>#hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by\\n#>#others.\\n#>\\n#>If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively\\n#>wrong, and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this\\n#>is possible.

I\\'m just explicit,\\nas in the line of postings you followed up, that when I express\\njudgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code\\nrather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad.\\nMy moral code is not particular different from that of others around\\nme, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists.  So when I say that I\\nobject to genocide, I\\'m not expressing anything particularly out of\\nline with what my society holds.\\n\\nIf your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it\\ndoes, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral\\ncode is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanity\\nprobably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of\\nour ability to exist in large societies, thereby achieving\\nconsiderable survival advantages.  You\\'d probably say that God just\\nmade the rules.  Neither of us can convince the other, but we share a\\ncommon understanding about many moral issues.  You think you get it\\nfrom your religion, I think I get it (and you get it) from early\\nchildhood teaching.\\n\\n\\nI think you\\'ve been reading the wrong sort of comic books, but in\\nprying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you\\'re\\nsaying.  I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as \"God\\ncommanded the genocide of the Canaanites\" is mechanistic, but of\\ncourse I think that\\'s true of you as well.  My reaction has little to\\ndo with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does, but\\nif a god existed who commanded genocide, I could not consider him\\ngood, which is supposedly an attribute of God.\\n\\n\\nHmm.  Yes, I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good.  I\\nhave as much place discussing values etc. as any other person.  In\\nfact, I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion, by\\nframing the questions in terms of reason: for instance, it is clear\\nthat in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt\\nto wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands, then the\\nquality of life will be generally poor, so a system that fosters\\ncoexistence is superior, if quality of life is an agreed goal.  An\\nabsolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of a\\nBible they happen to agree with, and say \"this is good\", even if the\\nact in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in\\nthe discussion.  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as\\n\"excluded from discussion\", such that they \"cannot participate\", and\\ntheir opinions given \"no weight whatsoever\" is the lowest form or\\nreasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort\\nof someone who can\\'t rationally defend their own ideas of right,\\nwrong, and the Bible.\\n-- \\nJim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC\\nThese are my opinions.

The physicists do not \\n          know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare \\n          that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF \\n          IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern \"science\" and help to \\n          cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox \\n          modern theories. \\n          \\n               Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a \\n          seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-\\n          OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT \\n          SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated \\n          pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment. \\n          \\n               Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy, \\n          but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by \\n          various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices, \\n          they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they \\n          can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy \\n          has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by \\n          clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced \\n          by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and \\n          high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and \\n          often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are \\n          suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.

They typically have a \\'SPARK GAP\\' in the circuit \\n          which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the \\n          energy being tapped.  It is important that the total \\n          \\'inductance\\' and \\'capacitance\\' of the Device combine to \\n          \\'RESONATE\\' at the same frequency as \\'EARTH RESONANCE\\' in \\n          order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be \\n          increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the \\'NEUTRAL CENTER\\' \\n          of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a \\n          Tesla Coil, slipping a \\'TOROID CHOKE COIL\\' around the \\n          secondary coil will enhance output power.  [\"Earth Energy: \\n          Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems\", by John Bigelow, 1976, \\n          Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.] \\n          \\n               During the 1930\\'s, an Austrian civil engineer named \\n          Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an \\n          \\'IMPLOSION TURBINE\\' (German name, \\'ZOKWENDLE\\'), after \\n          analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped \\n          waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical \\n          equations to explain it.  As described in the book \"A \\n          Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources\", by Dan A. Davidson, \\n          1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a \\n          LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a \\n          CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer \\n          touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump, \\n          which then converts the pump\\'s motor into an ELECTRIC \\n          GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that \\n          of the earth\\'s rotation, via the \\'Coriolis effect\\', LIKE A \\n          TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ] \\n          \\n               A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the \\'McClintock \\n          Air Motor\\' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between \\n          a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression \\n          ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and \\n          planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running \\n          by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also \\n          generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat \\n          buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large \\n          trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.  \\n          [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the \\n          automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.] \\n          \\n               Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown \\n          in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between \\n          metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of \\n          particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a \\n          common household smoke detector. \\n          \\n               One other energy source should be mentioned here, \\n          despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free \\n          Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph \\n          Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION \\n          reactor which he calls \\'Migma\\', which uses NON-radioactive \\n          deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities \\n          from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be \\n          converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting \\n          steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power \\n          a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the \\n          \"Tokamaks\" and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about, \\n          Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power \\n          for every watt put in.  [\"New Times\" (U.S. version), 6-26-78, \\n          pages 32-40.] \\n          \\n               And then there are the \\'cold fusion\\' experiments that \\n          have been in the news lately, originally conducted by \\n          University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin \\n          Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake \\n          Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of \\n          chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the \\n          bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with \\n          mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which \\n          PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough \\n          of it to explain the excess heat generated. \\n          \\n               There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called \"laws\" \\n          of thermodynamics are NOT so \"absolute\".  For example, the \\n          late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the \\'Reciprocal System\\', (which he describes in detail \\n          in several books such as \"Nothing But Motion\" (1979) and \"The \\n          Universe of Motion\" (1984)), in which the physical universe \\n          has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter \\n          half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing \\n          between them, with-OUT the \"heat death\" predicted by \\n          thermodynamic \"laws\".  His Theory explains the universe MUCH \\n          BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena \\n          that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some \\n          Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow, \\n          seemingly converting \"low-quality energy\" into \"high-quality \\n          energy\". \\n          \\n               Also, certain religious organizations such as \\'Sant Mat\\' \\n          and \\'Eckankar\\' teach their Members that the physical universe \\n          is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of \\n          existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV \\n          channels, as described in books like \"The Path of the \\n          Masters\", by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and \"Eckankar: The Key \\n          to Secret Worlds\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example, \\n          the next level up from the physical universe is commonly \\n          called the \\'Astral Plane\\'.  Long-time Members of these groups \\n          have learned to \\'Soul Travel\\' into these higher worlds and \\n          report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy \\n          could flow down from these higher levels into the physical \\n          universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given \\n          the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is \\n          supported by many successful laboratory-controlled \\n          experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as \\n          those described in the book \"Psychic Discoveries Behind the \\n          Iron Curtain\". \\n          \\n               In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors \\n          do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop \\n          and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional \\n          energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their \\n          VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If \\n          the government does not intervene, then the total supply of \\n          energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and \\n          will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and \\n          pollution and its harmful effects (including the \\'GREENHOUSE \\n          EFFECT\\', acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil \\n          spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue \\n          to increase. \\n          \\n               The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development \\n          of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize \\n          private production (until the producers can make it on their \\n          own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of \\n          Free Energy Hardware. \\n          \\n               The long-range effects of such government intervention \\n          would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy \\n          demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining \\n          companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$, \\n          etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to \\n          seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil, \\n          and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for \\n          conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero, \\n          while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high \\n          but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR\\'s, \\n          personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that \\n          require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease, \\n          along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be \\n          able to realize the \"opportunity costs\" of paying electric \\n          utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would \\n          benefit and increase because travelers would not have to \\n          spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government \\n          tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be \\n          obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE \\n          USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR. \\n          \\n               Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of \\n          business, but society as a whole, and the earth\\'s environment \\n          and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.

Dr. Wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind\\ncould be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of\\npossible futures; he says that this might be done by some sort of\\ncommunication between ones current, and possible future selves. \\nI have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self\\ndelusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection\\nof one of many possible futures.\\n\\nI realize that this gets pretty bizarre, but it never hurts to keep \\nan open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile \\nexplaination of the world in which we find ourselves.

This practice ranges\\nfrom \"devotional\" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-\\nical scripture as \"the Word of God.\"  And at the highest pitch, this leads\\nto a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that\\ncan act as \"absolute\" guidance for our actions.\\n\\nThe problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am\\ngoing to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians\\nhave looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.

In the case of communion, Paul\\'s mention (at least; this\\nis probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy\\nin which these words operate to \"bind\" Christians to the original command\\nto his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.\\n\\nI am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that\\nit is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.\\nI take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST\\'S notion,\\nthat *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus\\' command\\ndirected at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.\\nThe command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific\\ncontext of its statement to my own context as a \"disciple\" of Christ.\\n\\nAll reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out\\nof the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts\\n-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native\\nlanguages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without\\n*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original\\nlanguages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,\\nthat we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control\\n[ I don\\'t *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current\\npurposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already\\ncoped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world\\nthan the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-\\nvations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we\\ncan read the texts as the original audience might have done.\\n\\nAmong the reasons we have for seeing John\\'s _agapate allelou_ as a *general*\\ncommandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that\\none occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic \"Great Commandment\" is\\nthat we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom\\nwe congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, \"You have learnt\\nsay to you: love your enemies.\"  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted\\ndoes NOT say \\'hate your enemy\\' -- it is merely the common human presumption.\\n(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the \"love\" should extend to strangers\\namongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,\\ngoes on to have Jesus say. \"Even sinners love those who love them.\" [6:27]\\nAll of this suggests [quite strongly, I\\'d say :-)] that *limiting* the\\nscope of the \"new commandment\" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In\\nshort, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command\\nthat is \"in force\" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other\\nChristians.\\n\\nTrickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is\\nthe case of the \"Great Commission\" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve\\nare sent out to evangelize, \"Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close\\nat hand.\"  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather\\nspecific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in \"Do not\\nturn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town\"\\n-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus\\' final journey to\\nJerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians\\nthan the previous examples.  That hasn\\'t prevented Christians from MAKING\\nsuch an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference\\nis NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by\\nthe rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to\\nhave felt obliged to \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand\"\\neven (contrary to Jesus\\' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to\\nthe ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as\\na \"commandment\" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I \"accept\" this?  I don\\'t\\nknow.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of\\ninference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)\\ninfer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in\\nthe gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this\\nkind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*\\nhave an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable\\nlength) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*\\ninvolved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural\\n(though people will do their best to \"justify\" their assumptions by OTHER\\nreferences to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)\\n\\nLet\\'s move on to the \"Great Commandment\" -- that we should love God with\\nour whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic\\n\"equivalent\" of John\\'s _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED\\nas a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with\\nthe Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]\\n\\n\\t\"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees\\n\\tthey got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,\\n\\t\"Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?\"\\n\\nIt is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus\\'\\nanswer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a\\npolemic from his enemies.  [ Mark\\'s account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer\\nin a far more positive light as (so the \"scribe\" in this version says)\\n\"far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word\\noriginates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)\\nor sacrifice.\"  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question\\n\"to disconcert\" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains\\n[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one\\ncould be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this\\nsaid as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on\\nChristians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each\\ncase that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears\\nHAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about\\nwhat WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on\\nour understanding the point of Jesus\\' use of the Torah in the (all quite\\ndifferent) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.\\n\\nThe different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted\\nthat ONLY in Luke do we get the \"fixing\" of this command by the parable of\\nthe Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where\\n7:12 gives the \"Golden Rule\" as \"the meaning of the Law and the Prophets\"\\n(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation\\nbefore Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely\\nreasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not\\n*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of\\ninter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this \"intertextuality.\"\\n\\nMy discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ \"has\" to apply beyond the \\ncommunity of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,\\napplies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the\\npresentation not saying so explicitly) a \"commandment\" to Christians.\\nFew Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point\\nout that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains\\nof reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.\\n\\nThe contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at\\nthose sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as \\ncommandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is \\npretty clear, \"The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty\\nof adultery against her.\"  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew\\nhas an escape clause [ \"except in the case of fornication\", 5:31 ]. This\\nseems to be a rather clear \"commandment\" (whether or not we take Matthew\\'s\\nreservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don\\'t,\\nat least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were\\nnot explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the\\nthings people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands\\nof Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists\\nof the synoptic tradition?\\n\\nI\\'m going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this\\nis enough to start with.  The theme is: \"finding commandments in scripture\\nis an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,\\nthat is, our own cultural biases.\"  I have, so far, identified a very few\\n\"commandments\" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in\\nthese, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these\\ndifficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce\\ncommandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no\\nevidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn\\n*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or\\nmisc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that\\nUS law refuse to allow it, or refuse \"unrepentant divorcees\" places in\\ntheir churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn\\'t* enter into \\nconsideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in\\neven the most \"liberal\" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal\\nEpiscopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has\\nrecommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a\\n\"private\" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the \"public\" ceremony\\nhe celebrated need not go through an agonizing \"examination\" by officials\\nwho would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands\\nwe are faced with as Christians.

If anything, one could claim that,\\nin a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though being\\nHebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully\\nintroduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority \\nof the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has\\nKethuvim or Writing status.]\\n\\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade:\\n\\nDANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye\\'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name.\\nDaniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in\\nthe royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his\\nsalvation from death in a lion\\'s pit. He also appears in the last chapters of\\nthe book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel\\'s\\nrestoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in\\nthe court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per-\\nforms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel\\n7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him\\ndecode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name\\nDaniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known\\nfrom Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3).\\n  The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative\\nvoices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in\\nHebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels\\nthe subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations;\\n7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The\\noverall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7\\nis chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the\\nprefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some\\nyouths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a\\nsequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of\\nthis royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example,\\nDaniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar\\'s transformation into a beast, a story that\\nis reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the\\nlast king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede\\nwho conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such\\nDarius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of\\nseveral Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a\\nseries of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of\\nmiraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to\\nmid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine\\nprovidence and encourage steadfast faith.\\n  The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to\\nthat of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in\\nPalestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior\\nto the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews\\nwere put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral\\ntraditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a\\nmartyr\\'s death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions\\nof Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of\\nthe enthronement of a God of judgment, with a \"son of man\" invested with rule\\n(this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians\\nas Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre\\nmanifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient\\nprophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12.\\n  The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four\\nmetals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth\\nmonarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur-\\nvived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes\\nto the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the\\nfifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the\\nscientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth\\nMonarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony\\nto the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of\\ndiverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various\\ngroups predicting the apocalyptic advent.\\n  The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and\\npropagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah\\n52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as\\nthe select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor\\nthe final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather\\nadvocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation.\\nVictory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the\\nmartyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the\\ncircles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may\\nreflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of\\nresistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic\\nintegrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of\\nthe God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of\\ntrust for the faithful in their darkest hour.', 'I baptize you with water for repentance.\\n\\tBut after me will come one who is more powerful than I,\\n\\twhose sandals I am not fit to carry.\\n\\tHe will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.', 'Russell Turpin, as is his wont, has raised some interesting issues \\nin his struggle with the Christian texts and the Christians. \\nUnfortunately, he seems to be hoping for simplicity where it is \\nnot available.

And how\\ndo we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn\\'t screw up, or\\nput in their own little verses? And why can Muhammed marry more than four\\nwomen, when no other muslim is allowed to? (Although I think the biggest\\ninsult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to\\nsuppress a book, sight unseen, on the say-so of some \"holy\" guy.

For every twenty or so\\nnewspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there\\nwould\\nappear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how\\ndramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the\\nsituation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued\\nthroughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central\\nspotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman\\'s\\nright to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it\\'s\\ninteresting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up,\\nsome books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued\\nto be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these\\n\\ngroups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of \\nhate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard \\nwas annoying.)\\n\\nRushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at\\n\"organized\"\\nIslam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam\\nwhich Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a \"secular\" Islam - an Islam\\nseparated from it\\'s Qur\\'an, it\\'s Prophet, God, its legislation, and most\\nimportantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie\\nmade\\nhis views known - the Muslim\\'s made their anger at his book known. The\\nscale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this\\ntime,\\nalready a political situation - affecting governments as well as\\nindividuals.\\nThe situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications.\\nAt the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire -\\nengaged\\nin a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.\\n\\nNow you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as\\n\\nthis has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any\\nkind, has no\\nobligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till\\nmatters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in \"boldly\"\\ndefying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary\\nwork, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as\\na kind of secular \"heroic Knight\",mounted on the his media steed,\\n doing battle with the \"dragon\" of Islamic \"fundamentalism\".\\n\\nWell Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who \\ngrew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim\\'s hold dear, \\nwho wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions\\nto slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities -\\nwho, when\\nfaced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with\\nhis mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were\\ninjured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation,\\ncontinued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist.\\nKhomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief\\nmaking that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths\\nof Muslims around the world and Rushdie\\'s continued media mischief\\neven after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to\\ndecide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the\\ncentre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the\\ncontinuing mischief - all media support, government support was\\njust that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who\\nwere nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy\\nto see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that\\ndeal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief\\nmaking, was applied to Rushdie.\\n\\n\\nI have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. \"Image\" is\\nthe chief concern of Muslim \\'apologists\\' for Islam and for Rushdie.\\nIf Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture\\nwithin a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws\\nhad precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam\\nwould then be thought to have a good \"image\" (Principally because it would\\nby and large reflect the secular image). A \"good image\" usually means \" be\\nmore\\nlike me\".\\n\\nYour attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude\\nthat\\nresulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.\\n', '\\nWow! You got me thinking now!\\n\\nThis is an interesting question in that recently there has been a \\nmove in society to classify previously \"socially unacceptable\" yet legal \\nactivities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two \\ncoexisting methods of social control.\\n\\nFirst (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of \\nactions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set \\nof punishments.\\n\\nSecondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are \\nthe actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered \\nby legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if \\nsocialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed \\nsince most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of \\nsocial censure.\\n\\nThe control manifests itself in day-to-day life as \"guilt\" and \\n\"morality\".  I\\'ve heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren\\'t for \\nthe VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be \\nabsolutely impossible.\\n\\nLately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to \\nattempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain\\'t \\nillegal, then don\\'t pick on me).  I\\'m not saying this is wrong, merely \\nthat it is a byproduct of a society which has:\\n\\n\\t1) A high education level,\\n\\t2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media,\\n\\t3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and\\n\\t4) A \"me\" oriented culture.\\n\\nI guess what I\\'m saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition, \\nhere in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can\\\\\\ncan\\'t allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we \\nare fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as \\nthose freedoms don\\'t impinge on another\\'s.\\n\\nIMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.  While we \\nappreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old \\nterritoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized, \\ninherent fears based on ignorance will result in the \\ncontinued destabilization of society.  \\n\\nI got no quick fix.

Now the charge of\\napostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps \\ncharges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person \\nmakes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public\\nattacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the\\nsituation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads\\nslander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation\\nchanges. The punishments vary according to the situation\\nthe apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated\\napostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie\\'s case.\\n\\nThere is a distinction in the Qur\\'an between a formal war situation\\nand being in the situation where someone unilaterally\\nwages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. \\nagainst the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm \\nto Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could\\nbe said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is\\na clear difference between a formal war situation (where two\\nclearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange\\nprisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated\\nindividuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, \\nthe unilateral attack and the spreading of \"fasad\" that \\nwould apply in the case of Rushdie.\\n\\nThe matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an \\noffensive book (banning the book is secondary) -\\na full set of circumstances following the publication of\\nthe book come into play as well, including the deaths of many\\nMuslims, and Rushdie\\'s (and his publishers) Media games.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. I believe\\nthat one of the Qur\\'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.\\nEvery verse in the Qur\\'an has a corresponding \"circumstance of\\nrevelation\" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the\\nverse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance\\nin which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say\\nthat all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the\\nMuslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when\\nthey were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life\\nsituations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can\\nall be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal\\nrelationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that\\narriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how\\neach applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.\\nIt is not necessarily a simple \"this or that\" process. There may\\nbe many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in\\nwhich a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters\\nimpinge on the situation.\\n\\nIn other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur\\'an.\\nThe Qur\\'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must\\nentail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.\\nIf the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each\\nperson has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.\\nHowever, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to\\nthe\\nState, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,\\nthe dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there \\nare certain minimum requirements of understanding that one \\nshould achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of \\nthese requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:\\n\\n\"...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating\\nverse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,\\nand a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between\\na permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of\\nMeccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances \\nof revelation, and does not understand the technical words of\\nthe Qur\\'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the\\nknowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and\\ndelaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from\\nthe deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning\\nfrom the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,\\nthe disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,\\nand is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the\\nsubsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the\\ndetailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the\\nduties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and\\ndoes not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those\\ncoming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know\\nthe Qur\\'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur\\'an....\".\\n\\nBased on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur\\'anic\\nverses (\"Why should not a company from every group remain behind \\nto gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn \\npeople when they return to them, so that they may beware.\" (9:122)),\\na science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements\\nfor a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on\\nmatters of law and religion) are many. I\\'ve listed a few major \\ndivisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these\\nheadings.\\n\\n- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).\\n- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.\\n- Logic (mantiq)\\n- A knowledge of Hadiths\\n- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)\\n- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur\\'an, Sunnah, Consensus,\\nReasoning)\\n\\nThe study of Qur\\'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:\\n- discussion of imperatives (awamir)\\n- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)\\n- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)\\n- discussion of unconditional and conditional\\n- discussion of tacit meanings\\n- discussion of the abstract and the clear\\n- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated\\n\\nThe principles of Application of the law involves:\\n- principles of exemption\\n- principles of precaution\\n- principles of option\\n- principles of mastery\\n\\nThe jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process\\nin pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter\\nof looking at one verse and one hadith. \\n\\nNow no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference\\nbetween blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is\\nclearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the\\n\"The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as \\nlong as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,\\nand wealth of this world.\" The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: \"O Messenger\\nof God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?\" He (S.A.) replied:\\n\"By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for\\nyour religion and shun them.\" I do not yet know enough about the Imams\\nof the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies\\nto them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.\\n\\nThe Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as \"The fortress of Islam\". My only\\npoint is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into\\nplay a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is \\ndelineated in the Qur\\'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise\\nare praised in both the Qur\\'an and hadith - those who without the requisite\\nknowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion \\nare cautioned.\\n\\nThe only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this\\ngroup, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is,\\napostasy), was wrong.

The problem with a \"moment of\\nsilence\" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of \"allowing\" for religion\\namongst students in the public schools.  As I noted before, Muslims need\\nmore than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are\\nrequired by Muhammad to do.  And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also\\nhas requirements that are not addressed by this.\\n\\nThere is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in\\nthis \"moment of silence\" shit.  And that is especially bizarre in that\\nChristian prayer DOESN\\'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally\\nincognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews\\nas well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some\\ncharacteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special\\ntimes and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer \\nbeing able taking note of it.)\\n\\nA Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of\\nhis activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of the\\nother religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME\\nforms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant\\n\"mainstream\" religion.\\n\\nAll that a \"moment of silence\" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which\\ndoesn\\'t NEED it, to have a \"special\" place set aside in the public schools.\\nThere is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs,\\nor phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A\\nChristian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during\\nthe day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non-\\nChristians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the \"moment of silence\" it\\nwould STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims\\nto do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed\\nforms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore,\\nthe provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.\\n\\nLuckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as\\na Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools),\\nand a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the political\\nforces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms\\non non-Christians.\\n\\nAs far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this \"moment of\\nsilence\" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE\\nchildren to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  And\\nas a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.  For what it\\'s worth, I\\nsuspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians --\\nit is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in \"making\"\\ntheir children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach\\nwhat THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in\\nthe world to do so.\\n\\nIf you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of\\nsilence in school.  If you have NOT managed to teach them, the moment\\nwill only embarrass you.  Give it up.', '\\nYes, one does.  I examined a critique of the Book of Romans by\\nI think, Benjamin Franklin once, a Deist.  I found it amazing that\\nBenjamin Franklin missed the whole boat.   I also have the writings\\non Thomas Jefferson sitting on my shelf, and it is amazing how\\nmuch he missed.  I have studied Plato\\'s Theory of Forms and \\nAristotelian Hylomorphesism.  What a pile of junk.  Jesus\\nmakes Plato and Aristotle look like kindergardeners.  Psychology,\\nthe id, ego, superego by Freud?  Elements of truth, but Jesus\\nexplained it far better and gave reasons.\\n\\nThomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson are mere men.  They\\ncan screw up the Bible just as well as any man.  I do not put these\\nmen on a pedestal.  And if I remember T.J.\\'s autobiography correctly,\\nhe thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever met.\\n\\nHere\\'s some more circular reasoning to you.  Paul says to the Corinthians\\nthat \"that the gospel will be foolishness to the world, because it is \\nspiritually discerned.\"  And so, people without the spirit of God haven\\'t a\\nclue to what the Bible is saying.   From your point of view, that\\'s\\nincredibly circular and convenient.   To me, it is mysteriously and supernaturally\\nbizarre.   I can see it, but you can\\'t.  This is not arrogance on\\nmy part.  Trust me.  It is as bizarre to you as it is to me.  But nonetheless,\\nit is a truth, explainable or not.\\n\\nAre any of you color blind to red and green?  I am.  Remember those\\ndot tests they do at the optomologist\\'s?  They put pictures in front\\nof you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots?  If\\nyour eyes are perfectly normal, you can see letters or numerals\\nembedded in the dots.  They are a slightly different color and stand\\nout from the background.  But if you are color blind to red and green,\\nyou will not see anything but gray-shaded dots.  That is how a dot\\ntest appears to me.  I do not see a pattern at all.\\n\\nA normal seeing person will see the patterns.  And to him, I seem like a\\ntotal anomaly.

I can see how the patterns\\nfit together.  There is such depth.  Such consistency.   But then, on the\\nother hand, I notice the non-believer.   He doesn\\'t see it.  He thinks\\nI am weird because he thinks I am seeing things.   I look at him, and\\nsay, \"No, you are weird.  You do not see.\"   Then it is time for a sanity\\ncheck.  I go to another Christian and say, \"Do you see this.\"  And\\nthey go, \"Yes.  It is an \"X\"\".  And I say, \"Thank God, I see the \"X\"\\ntoo.\"\\n\\nIt is truly the strangest thing.

Larson\\'s Background\\n    \\n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \\n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \\n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \\n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \\n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \\n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \\n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \\n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \\n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \\n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \\n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \\n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \\n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \\n     \\n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \\n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \\n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \\n          researchers\\' experimental and observational data.  And in \\n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \\n    \\n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \\n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \\n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \\n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \\n    \\n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \\n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\\'s books are FULL of \\n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \\n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \\n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \\n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \\n    \\n    \\n               Prof. Frank H.

He moved to \\n          Minneapolis after retiring. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\\n          \\n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \\n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \\n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \\n          value. \\n    \\n               Most physicists don\\'t realize it, but, according to the \\n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \\n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \\n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \\n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \\n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \\n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \\n          with their environment. \\n    \\n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \\n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \\n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \\n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \\n    \\n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \\n          BILLION cost?!!  Don\\'t we have much more important uses for \\n          this WASTED money?! \\n    \\n     \\n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \\n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \\n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \\n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \\n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \\n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \\n    \\n          \\n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \\n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \\n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \\n      \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\\n          \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \\n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \\n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \\n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \\n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \\n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \\n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \\n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \\n          other. \\n      \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \\n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \\n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \\n          MATERIAL half. \\n       \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\\n          \\n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \\n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \\n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \\n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \\n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \\n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \\n          help \"prove\" Einstein\\'s \"General Theory of Relativity\". \\n    \\n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \\n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \\n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \\n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \\n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \\n    \\n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \\n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \\n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \\n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \\n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \\n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \\n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \\n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \\n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \\n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \\n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \\n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \\n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \\n          about this.] \\n    \\n     \\n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \\n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \\n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \\n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \\n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\\'s Theory, \\n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \\n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \\n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \\n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \\n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \\n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \\n          FANTASY). \\n    \\n                                    \\n          \\n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\n\\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \\n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \\n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \\n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \\n    \\n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \\n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \\n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \\n    \\n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \\n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \\n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \\n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \\n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \\n    \\n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \\n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \\n          OPEN MINDS! \\n    \\n               The following is an example of his Theory\\'s success: \\n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \\n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \\n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \\n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\'s \\n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \\n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \\n    \\n\\n \\n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\\n\\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \\n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \\n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \\n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \\n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \\n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \\n          directional coincidence). \\n    \\n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \\n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \\n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \\n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \\n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \\n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \\n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \\n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \\n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \\n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \\n          directions uniformly.) \\n    \\n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \\n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \\n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \\n          stop it! \\n    \\n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \\n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \\n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\\n          \\n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \\n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \\n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \\n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \\n    \\n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \\n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \\n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \\n          B. Larson. \\n    \\n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \\n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \\n          and in some of his other books. \\n    \\n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \\n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \\n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \\n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \\n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \\n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\\'s internal \\n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \\n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \\n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \\n          lighter elements. \\n    \\n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \\n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \\n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \\n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \\n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \\n          of his books [better than I can]. \\n    \\n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \\n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \\n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \\n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \\n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \\n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \\n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \\n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \\n    \\n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \\n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \\n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \\n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \\n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \\n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \\n          Diagram. \\n    \\n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \\n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \\n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \\n          system, orbiting each other. \\n     \\n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \\n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \\n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \\n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \\n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\\n\\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \\n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \\n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \\n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \\n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \\n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \\n      \\n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \\n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \\n          his own version of Bode\\'s Law. \\n          \\n\\n\\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\\n\\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \\n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \\n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \\n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \\n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \\n    \\n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \\n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \\n          holes\", etc.! \\n    \\n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s books about \\n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \\n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \\n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \\n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \\n          to \"prove\" their theory. \\n    \\n    \\n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \\n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \\n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\\'s severe physical \\n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \\n    \\n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \\n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\\'s \\n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \\n          Unified Science). \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\\n\\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \\n          with UFO\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \\n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \\n    \\n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \\n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \\n          Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \\n    \\n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \\n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \\n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \\n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \\n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson\\'s book \"NOTHING BUT \\n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \\n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \\n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \\n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \\n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \\n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \\n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \\n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \\n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \\n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \\n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \\n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \\n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \\n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \\n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \\n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \\n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \\n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \\n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \\n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \\n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \\n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \\n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \\n          \\n               Note that in Larson\\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are \\n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \\n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \\n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \\n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \\n          according to Larson\\'s Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \\n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \\n    \\n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \\n          light! \\n    \\n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \\n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \\n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \\n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \\n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson\\'s Theory, an electrical charge \\n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \\n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \\n          rotation of the particle.) \\n      \\n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \\n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \\n          generated in clouds. \\n\\n\\n\\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\\n\\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B.

Your reasoning, as I see it, is very much along the\\nlines of Roger Penrose, who claimed that mathematical \\'insight\\' cannot\\nbe algorithmic in his book _The emperor\\'s new mind: Concerning\\ncomputers, minds, and the laws of physics_. However, Penrose\\'s\\nclaim that he _has_ mathematical insight, or your similar claim\\nthat wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look,\\ncould be just illusions.\\n\\nWe are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints - I try to ponder\\non the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective,\\nrealising that it might not be anything special, but certainly\\nuseful. Thinking back of what I wrote, do you think worms have minds\\nor not? They are able to experience pain, at least they behave \\njust like that. Yet it is conceivable that we might some day\\nin the future perform a \"total synthesis of C. elegans\" from\\nthe elements. Would such a worm have a mind?\\n\\n\\nThis is true to some extent. However, I do not think that our brains\\nwork like computers, at all. In fact, there is substantial evidence\\n(Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or less\\nchaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve.\\nOur brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.\\n\\n\\nIndeed, this is extremely unlikely, given the vast impact of nurture\\non our mind and brain. I suggest, however, that before trying to\\nunderstand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms. \\n\\nKevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again.\\nI still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind\\nare neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not \\nflame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are\\nconscious. \\n\\nThe reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot\\nlead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.\\n\\nAnd please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not\\nall physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness\\nplays some special role in physics. I would say it doesn\\'t.\\n\\n\\nAgain, _brains are not computers_. Don\\'t forget this. This does not\\nmean they need something else to work - they just work differently.\\nTheir primary \\'purpose\\' is perception and guidance of action, \\nself-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.\\n\\n\\nYou are still expecting that we could find the idea of \\'green\\' in\\nour brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is\\nnot how I see it. The sensation \\'green\\' is a certain time-dependent\\npattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed\\nwith the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain. \\n\\nIndeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness\\nas a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns,\\nbut this is just idle speculation.\\n\\nScientific American\\'s September 1992 issue was a special issue on\\nmind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-)\\nThere are two articles on visual perception, so you might be \\ninterested.\\n\\nBut again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be \\nobserved from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but \\nneuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the\\nmind.\\n\\nKalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation\\nof different areas of brain have led to various changes in the \\npatients\\' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area\\nwas stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during\\na psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and\\nstarted discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.\\n\\nStimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing\\nsituations, when the patients have started flirting with the\\ntherapist.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there is evidence that\\n\\n1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences, \\n   brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage\\n\\n2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in\\n   various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our\\n   visual cortex is activated etc.\\n\\n3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our\\n   actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead\\n   of our \\'conscious will\\' by at least 350 ms. \\n\\nThus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question \"Why do \\'I\\' see\\ncolours\" around and ask \"What is this \\'I\\' that seems to be \\nobserving?\", since it seems that our conscious mind is not\\nthe king of our brains.\\n\\n\\nThis depends on what is meant by \\'seeing colours\\'. Does a neural\\nnetwork that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from\\n0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?\\n\\nIf you are asking, \"why does an animal who is conscious of itself\\nas an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who\\ndoesn\\'t\", I have a good answer - read my previous posting,\\nwhere I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap\\nroles and act more morally, so that they don\\'t unconsciously\\nkill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme,\\nbut this is the basic idea.)\\n\\nWhen early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools, \\na sense of identity and the concept of \\'self\\' had to evolve in\\nline with this development. Indeed, respect for others and \\nconscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages\\nfor social animals, such as early humans. \\n\\n\\nIf minds are required for this, does this mean that until human\\nminds came to the scene, wavefunctions never collapsed, but remained\\nin the superpositions for aeons? My, how powerful we are.\\n\\nThis has been discussed before, and I think this topic is irrelevant,\\nsince we do not agree that minds are necessary, and neither do\\nphysicists. \\n\\n\\nI agree, but not in the sense you apparently mean above - physics\\nneeds sharp minds to solve many real problems. ;-)\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s OK, if you don\\'t forget to take with you the references I\\nwrote about in my previous posting, plus the following:\\n\\nKalat, James W.

So, in\\nthe context of a.a, would you take a stand based on what you actually\\nknow to be true or on what you want to be true and how can you tell\\nthe difference?', ': The willingness of true believers\\n: to die for their belief, be it in Jesus or Jim Jones, is\\n: well-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little.\\n\\nIt does say something about the depth of their belief.  Religion has\\nboth deluded believers and con men.  The difference is often how far\\nthey will follow their beliefs.\\n\\nI have no first hand, or even second hand, knowledge of how the \\noriginal apostles died.  If they began a myth in hopes of exploiting\\nit for profit, and followed that myth to the death, that would be\\ninconsistent.  Real con men would bail out when it was obvious it would \\nlead to discomfort, pain and death.', '\\nSadly understandable...\\n\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nTo be fair, you should really qualify this as semitic-western religions, but\\nyou basically go ahead and do this later on anyway.\\n\\n\\nAgain, this should really be evaluated at a personal level.  For example, there\\nwas only one Jesus (presumably), and he probably didn\\'t say all that many\\nthings, and yet (seemingly) billions and billions of Christian sects have\\narisen.  Perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and\\nbelieves in Christ as in pantheism.  It would seem to go against the Bible, but\\nit is amazing what people come up with under the guise of \"personal\\ninterpretation\".\\n\\n\\nThis is a good point.  We have here the quintessential Christian: he sets up a\\nsystem of values/beliefs for himself, which work very well, and every\\nevent/experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this\\nsystem.  However, we also have an individual who has the inability (at least\\nnot without some difficulty) to change, which is important, because the problem\\nwith such a system is the same as with any system: one cannot be open minded to\\nthe point of \"testing hypotheses\" against the basic premise of the system\\nwithout destroying whatever faith is invested therein, unless of course, all\\nthe tests fail.  In other words, the *fairer* way would be to test and evaluate\\nmoralities without the bias/responsibility of losing/retaining a system.\\n\\n\\nInteresting, but again, when it seems to basically boil down to individual\\nnuances (although not always, I will admit, and probably it is the\\nmass-oriented divisions which are the most appalling), it becomes irrelevant,\\nunfortunately.\\n\\n\\nGranted\\n\\n\\nIn which case the people become the bullets, and the religion, as the gun,\\nmerely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves, if I\\nmay be so bold as to extend your similie?\\n\\n\\nAlso understandable... ;)\\n\\n-- \\n\\nbest regards,\\n', '\\nI read it.

Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\\n\\n   If you don\\'t find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn\\'t set up\\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\\n   problem.\\n\\n3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.226].\\n   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you\\'ll find the latest\\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\\n\\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.

There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\\n   \"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\" carries a list of these\\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\\n\\n5.

(Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\\n   if you\\'ve tried the above methods and they\\'ve failed; it\\'s not nice to\\n   clutter the newsgroup or people\\'s mailboxes with requests for files.\\n   it\\'s better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!

They\\'re\\ngreat at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not\\nat working out the method itself.\\n\\nAs a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the\\nsimple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do\\nthese with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.\\nNow, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but\\nin doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program\\nthem into the computer. You can, of course, \\'obfuscate\\' the trick, and\\nwrite the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,\\nthe trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does\\nthis mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already\\npre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that\\nour brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic\\nmaterial, much of which isn\\'t used.\\n\\nOne way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but\\n(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of \\'if you see\\nobject X, then perform action Y,\\' and we don\\'t seem to get anywhere.\\nThe algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what\\nconclusions to draw from it\\'s experience.\\n\\nThe other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many\\nalgorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet\\npeople survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are\\nside-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,\\nneurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -\\ncan an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\\'s\\ncode?\\n\\nThe next problem is the sticky question of \"What is colour?\" (replace\\n\\'colour\\' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\\nmaterialist viewpoint is that it\\'s the product of some kind of\\nchemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\\ndifferent chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a\\ncomputer won\\'t see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an\\nalgorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an\\nequivalent that doesn\\'t? It shouldn\\'t, because the outputs of each\\nalgorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do\\nwe see colour?\\n\\n\\n\\nA bit of idle speculation...\\n\\nIf I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\\nwith two processes acting on it. The first process has been called\\n\\'Unitary Evolution\\' (or \\'U\\'), is governed by Schroedinger\\'s equation\\nand is well known. The second process, called various things such as\\n\\'collapse of the wavefunction\\' or \\'state vector reduction\\' (or \\'R\\'),\\nand is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a\\n\\'measurement\\' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely\\nwhen that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly\\nchange the wavefunction.\\n\\nI envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and \\'something\\nelse,\\' which I shall imaginitively call \\'part X.\\' It seems reasonable\\nto assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be\\nthe wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the\\nwavefunction. Note, though, that we\\'d need more than U to explain R.)\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to\\nbe some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear\\nsuperpositions of anything, although there are alternative\\nexplainations for this. I\\'ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access\\npart X, but since this is only speculation, that won\\'t matter too\\nmuch :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in\\nphysics.\\n\\nI\\'ll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that\\'s OK with you :-)\\n\\n\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nKevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk\\n            Don\\'t believe anything you read in .sig files.', '\\n\\n\\tIs there room for nudists?

It\\'s from\\n\\n  P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG\\')  where G\\' is the complement of G\\n\\nand by axiom, P(anything) >= 0, so P(HG\\') >= 0, so P(H) >= P(HG).\\n\\nIn a sense, HG is necessarily more \"complicated\" than H for any H and G,\\nso I may be splitting hairs, but what I\\'m trying to say is that irrespective\\nof subjective impressions of how complicated something is, P(H) >= P(HG)\\nholds, with equality if and only if P(HG\\') = 0.\\n\\n\\nWell, \"P(x | A) = P(x | B)\" means that x is as likely to be observed if A is\\noperative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not\\nprovide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between\\nthe respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference\\nreduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior\\nprobabilities P(A) and P(B):\\n\\n  P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>\\n\\n    P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)\\n\\nwhere k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).\\n\\nSo A and B are \"equally consistent with the data\" in that observing x\\ndoesn\\'t give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.\\n\\nIn the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that their\\nprior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we don\\'t know\\nthe actual values, and it\\'s this which allows us to deploy the Razor to\\nthrow out any such HG.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s certainly true, but the particular point here was whether or\\nnot a `divine component\\' actually underlies the prevalence of religion\\nin addition to the memetic transmission component, which even the religious\\nimplicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word\\'.\\n\\nNow it seems to me, as I\\'ve said, that the observed variance in religious\\nbelief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model, but rather\\n*less* well if one proposes a `divine component\\' in addition, since I would\\nexpect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual\\nexclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isn\\'t\\neven equal to P(x | H) in this case, but is smaller (H is memetic transmission,\\nG is `divine component\\', x is the variance among beliefs). But I happily\\nacknowledge that this is a subjective impression.\\n\\n\\nNot that I\\'m a statistician as such either, but:\\n\\nThe idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of\\nthe (read `my\\') observations to date. However, theism (of the type with\\nwhich I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may be\\nanswered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable\\nto statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in\\nmeasurable ways.\\n\\nThis means that these regions of the space of possible observations, \\nwhich I loosely termed \"appearances of god/s\", have some nonzero\\nprobability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.\\n\\nSince there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to\\nscatter around over the observation space, the probability which theism\\nexpends on making \"appearances of god/s\" possible must come from somewhere\\nelse (i.e. other possible observations).\\n\\nAll else being equal, this means that an observation which *isn\\'t* an\\n\"appearance of god/s\" must have a slightly higher probability under\\natheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such\\nobservations must cause my running estimate for the probability of\\nthe atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decrease\\nin my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.\\n\\nSorry if that\\'s still a bit jargonesque, but it\\'s rather difficult to\\nput it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the properties\\nof conditional probability densities, and particularly that the total\\narea under them is always unity.\\n\\nAn analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is \"the\\ncoin is fair\", and that B is \"the coin is unfair (two-headed)\". (I\\'ve\\nused A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)\\n\\nThen\\n\\n  P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1\\n  P(T | A) = 0.5  }\\n\\n  P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1\\n  P(T | B) = 0    }\\n\\nThe observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatible\\nwith both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probability\\nexpended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they\\ndon\\'t actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total must\\nbe unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance\\nof heads.\\n\\nSay our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The\\nobservation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates are\\nmodified according to\\n\\n                            P(H | A)\\n  e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m\\n                              P(H)\\n\\nand\\n\\n                            P(H | B)\\n  e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m\\n                              P(H)\\n\\nNow we don\\'t know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, but\\nthe multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time\\nthe coin is tossed and a head is observed.\\n\\nThus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have\\n\\n                 n\\n  e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)\\n\\nand\\n                    n\\n  e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),\\n\\nand since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1\\nand thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must\\ndecrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must\\nincrease, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.\\n\\nThe loose analogy is between \"unfair coin\" and atheism, and between \"fair\\ncoin\" and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, which\\nwould falsify \"unfair coin\", is analogous to an \"appearance of god/s\",\\nwhich would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends\\nto the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principle\\nis the same.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuite so, but this type of theism is what I might call \"the G in the HG\",\\nin terms of our Ockham\\'s Razor discussion, and I\\'d bin it on those grounds.\\n\\n\\nThe hypotheses don\\'t have to be falsifiable, and indeed in my `model\\',\\nthe theism isn\\'t falsifiable.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to. We don\\'t need, in the above analogy, to know *any*\\nprior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the\\nfair-coin hypothesis is less than unity, and that the corresponding\\nmultiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity.\\nYou don\\'t need to know the initial values of the running estimates\\neither. It\\'s clear that after a large number of observations, P(fair-coin)\\napproaches zero and P(two-headed-coin) approaches unity.\\n\\nAll you need to know is whether P(x | Ha) is larger than P(x | Ht) for\\nobserved x, and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain\\nevents rendered *possible* (not necessary) under Ht which are not possible\\nunder Ha, and all else is equal.\\n\\n\\nAny observations you like; it really doesn\\'t matter, nor affect the\\nreasoning, provided that there are some possible observations which\\nwould count as \"appearances of god/s\". Examples of this might be\\na demonstration of the efficacy of prayer, or of the veracity of\\nrevelation.\\n\\n\\n\\nOK, we\\'ll downgrade \"*does* interact\" to \"*may* interact\", which would\\nactually be better since \"does interact\" implies a falsifiability which\\nwe both agree is misplaced.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll explain, but bear in mind that this isn\\'t central; all I require of\\na theism is that it *not* make the prediction \"Appearances of god/s will\\nnever happen\", as does atheism. (Before somebody points out that quantum\\nmechanics doesn\\'t make this prediction either, the difference is that\\nQM and atheism do not form a partition.)\\n\\nPredictions include such statements as \"Prayer is efficacious\" (implying\\n\"If you do the stats, you will find that Prayer is efficacious\"), or \"Prayer\\nis *not* efficacious\", or \"Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not\\npass, till all these things be fulfilled.\" I don\\'t think we have any problems\\nof misunderstanding here.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s fine; I don\\'t claim that theism is false, merely that the [finite\\nnumber of] observations available to me so far suggest that it is, and\\nthat as I continue to observe, the suggestion looks better and better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI think you are; an \"appearance of god/s\" is sufficient to falsify\\natheism, whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable.\\n\\n\\nNo: by way of a counterexample, let X = \"the coin is fair\", or more\\naccurately (so that not(X) makes sense) \"the two sides of the coin are\\ndifferent\". This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin; even a string of\\nheads is consistent with a fair coin, and you have to go to an infinite\\nnumber of tosses to falsify X in the limit. Its converse is falsifiable,\\nand is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOops. Sorry. Mea culpa.\\n\\n\\nWe agree here.\\n\\n\\n\"The Rapture will not happen on October 28 1992.\" Said Rapture would have\\nfalsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened, although its failure\\nto happen does not, of course, falsify any theisms other than those which\\nspecifically predicted it.\\n\\n\"No phenomenon which requires the existence of one or more gods for its\\nexplanation will ever be observed.\" That about sums the whole thing up.\\n\\n\\nCheers\\n\\nSimon', \"\\nSounds like you were going to a different Penn State or something.\\nKampus Krusade for Khrist is very vocal here, but they really have\\nlittle power to get anything done.

People can recuperate the\\nactual costs of printing (paper, copy center charges), but may not charge\\nanything for their time in making copies, or in any way realize a profit\\nfrom the use of this book. See the permissions notice in the book itself\\nfor the precise terms.\\n\\nNegotiations are currently underway with a Mormon publisher vis-a-vis the\\nprinting and distribution of bound books. (Sorry, I\\'m out of the wire-bound\\n\"first editions.\") I will make another announcement about the availability\\nof printed copies once everything has been worked out.\\n\\nFTP information: connect via anonymous ftp to carnot.itc.cmu.edu, then \"cd\\npub\" (you won\\'t see anything at all until you do).\\n\\n\"The Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon\" is currently available in postscript and\\nRTF (rich text format). (ASCII, LaTeX, and other versions can be made\\navailable; contact dba@andrew.cmu.edu for details.) You should be able to\\nprint the postscript file on any postscript printer (such as an Apple\\nLaserwriter); let dba know if you have any difficulties. (The postscript in\\nthe last release had problems on some printers; this time it should work\\nbetter.) RTF is a standard document interchange format that can be read in\\nby a number of word processors, including Microsoft Word for both the\\nMacintosh and Windows. If you don\\'t have a postscript printer, you may be\\nable to use the RTF file to print out a copy of the book.\\n\\n-r--r--r--  1 dba                   1984742 Apr 27 13:12 etrbom.ps\\n-r--r--r--  1 dba                   1209071 Apr 27 13:13 etrbom.rtf\\n\\nFor more information about how this project came about, please refer to my\\narticle in the current issue of _Sunstone_, entitled \"Delighting in\\nPlainness: Issues Surrounding a Simple Modern English Book of Mormon.\"\\n\\nSend all inquiries and comments to:\\n\\n    Lynn Matthews Anderson\\n    5806 Hampton Street\\n    Pittsburgh, PA 15206'], 'filenames': array(['C:\\\\Users\\\\linda\\\\scikit_learn_data\\\\20news_home\\\\20news-bydate-test\\\\alt.atheism\\\\53495',\n",

The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   ==========\\n    Classes                     20\\n    Samples total            18846\\n    Dimensionality               1\\n    Features                  text\\n    =================   ==========\\n\\nUsage\\n~~~~~\\n\\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n   \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n   \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n   \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n   \\'rec.autos\\',\\n   \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n   \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n   \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n   \\'sci.med\\',\\n   \\'sci.space\\',\\n   \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n   \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes.

Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata.
