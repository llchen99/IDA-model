This folder contains the final version of the v2.0 IDA tool.
The main model is v2.0_IDmodel.py. Any actions before running are displayed 
using "NB" comments. This is mainly changing the locations of the files.
The needed functions can be found in the folder "functions", which also has to be added to the path.
A few other "NB" comments can be used to look at features of the model that are descriptive and 
thus don't need to be displayed every time. 

'laurasmodel.py' is the model of the manually selected features.

Earlier versions of the model can also be found on github, under "older versions".
At the top of each of these older versions is a short log of changes in which the most 
important changes are listed of that version.
